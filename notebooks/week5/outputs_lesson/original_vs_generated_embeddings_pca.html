At first I would oblige. I thought \"Whatever, it will only take a few seconds, NBD\". But as it happens more and more, I'm starting to realize not everyone is being asked to do this.

The definitive treatment is a surgery and lengthy hospital stay which costs about $25k out-of-pocket after insurance deductions, and quoted at 70% cure rate. He and my SIL are unable to afford this as they have combined debts of $40k including student loans and not eligible to ...","[Post 3315] AITA for shaming a barber online that refused to serve me?\n\nI am a woman in my 20s who has very short hair. It isn't just short, it is straight up a men's cut, as I am very masculine/butch looking in general. For the past couple years I have been getting my hair cut at a barber, since it's cheaper and they never try to push me to have a more feminine pixie cut. \n\nMy barber moved away recently, so I have been looking for someone new. At the recommendation of my male friend, I found a ...","[Post 15962] AITA for not defending my wife at the dinner table?\n\nmy wife (27f) and me (36m) were having thanksgiving dinner at my parents' house last thursday. My wife has this weird habit of eating with a teaspoon all the time, instead of a regular spoon so when she and my mom were setting the table, she took a teaspoon for herself. Anyways, when she was eating with it, my dad pointed it out to her and asked \"why on earth are you eating with that tiny spoon?

Hes also a gaming junkie-like the worst of their kind. For example, when a game is being released, he waits up until midnight to purchase the game (no matte...","[Post 14190] AITA for refusing to cook dinner if my roommate won't do the dishes?\n\nSo about 5 months ago I (29F) got a new place with two of my friends, let's call them Todd(33M) and Jess(32F). The three of us split rent and utilities equally. We all have a similar cleanliness level and a general rule of clean up after yourself. Everyone does their own laundry, keeps their bedrooms tidy, and the common spaces like the livingroom and kitchen get cleaned regularly by all of us.
