    "The Gemini API offers a way to interact with one of Google‚Äôs advanced language models‚Äîsystems trained to generate, summarize, or reinterpret text and images. Rather than merely a technical tool, we can think of this API as a hermeneutic interface: a structured channel through which human queries are filtered, transformed, and responded to by an algorithmic agent.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Overview of Gemini Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Google offers different Gemini models, each with its own strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gemini Flash:** This model is super fast and efficient. It's great for tasks where you need quick responses or are handling many requests, like summarizing text on the fly or powering a chatbot that needs to reply instantly. It can understand text, images, audio, and video!\n",
    "* **Gemini Pro:** This is a more powerful model, excellent for complex tasks that require deeper understanding and reasoning. For example, if you need a detailed analysis or very creative content, Pro is a great choice. It's also multimodal, meaning it can handle different types of input (text, images, etc.).\n",
    "* **Gemini Ultra:** This is the most capable model, designed for highly complex tasks. (Access to Ultra might be different or more limited, so we'll focus on Flash and Pro for this course as they have generous free tiers to get started).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Capabilities:**\n",
    "* **Multimodality:** This fancy word means Gemini can understand and process information from different formats, not just text. You can give it an image and ask questions about it, or provide audio and get a transcript. We'll explore this more in Module 2!\n",
    "* **Long Context:** Some Gemini models can remember and process a very large amount of information at once (like an entire book!). This is called having a \"long context window.\" The `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-1.5-pro` models we'll be looking at can handle up to 1 million *tokens* (we'll explain tokens later), which is a lot of text!"

    "* `top_p`: (Ranges 0.0 to 1.0). Nucleus sampling. The model considers only the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `top_p`. For example, if `top_p` is 0.8, it picks from the most likely tokens that add up to 80% probability. This can lead to more diverse but still coherent output. It's often used as an alternative to `temperature`.\n",

(Note: Support for `top_k` can vary between models and API versions. Always check the documentation. Gemini API documentation often emphasizes `temperature` and `top_p`.)\n",
    "* `max_output_tokens`: Sets the maximum number of tokens the model should generate in its response. Useful for keeping responses concise or within certain limits.\n",

    "# Understanding Gemini's Safety Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gemini API allows you to configure **safety settings** that influence what kinds of content the model will generate or block. This is important for managing risk when working with morally sensitive or harmful inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can adjust safety thresholds across the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Harassment** ‚Äì targeted insults or malicious language  \n",
    "- **Hate Speech** ‚Äì language that promotes hatred or violence toward identity groups  \n",
    "- **Sexually Explicit** ‚Äì graphic or suggestive sexual content  \n",
    "- **Dangerous Content** ‚Äì encouragement of harmful behavior (e.g., violence, self-harm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini uses two configuration tools:\n",
    "- `HarmCategory` ‚Äì selects the type of risk to filter\n",
    "- `HarmBlockThreshold` ‚Äì controls how sensitive the filter is, with options like:\n",
    "  - `BLOCK_NONE` (no filtering)\n",
    "  - `BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH` (only blocks very likely harm)\n",
    "  - `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE` (a safe middle ground)\n",
    "  - `BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE` (strict filtering)\n",
    "\n",
    "Newer Gemini models sometimes default to **less strict settings**, placing responsibility on the developer to decide what's appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we test how Gemini responds to two versions of the same r/AITA scenario: one written in a neutral tone, and one made intentionally more explicit. We run these under both default and stricter safety settings, then ask Gemini to reflect on whether the post should be moderated."

      " This post contains elements that a responsible content moderation system would likely flag, though perhaps not for the reasons one might initially expect.  While it doesn't contain direct calls for violence or explicitly hateful language towards a protected group in the way that many systems are trained to detect, it does touch on several sensitive areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Potential for inciting violence/retaliation:** While the author is the victim of harassment, the description of their actions ‚Äì throwing a drink in the aggressors' faces ‚Äì could be interpreted by some as violence, and might inspire similar actions by others who experience similar harassment. The final line, \"did I not go far enough?\", could be seen as escalating the situation and potentially justifying further actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hate speech (contextual):** The aggressors used homophobic slurs (\"psycho faggot\"). While the post doesn't use such language itself, the detailed description of the incident, including the slur, could be flagged depending on the platform's sensitivity settings. The contextual inclusion of the slur might be enough to warrant a flag.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Self-harm/Suicidal Ideation (subtle):** The line \"I called 911 but hung up. I‚Äôve dealt with enough useless cops\" suggests a lack of trust in authority and potential feelings of helplessness. While not explicitly suicidal, this could be flagged by a system trained to detect subtle indicators of self-harm or despair, especially in conjunction with the overall tone of the post.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Graphic Violence (implied):** The description of the cold brew exploding in the aggressors' faces, while not gratuitous, depicts a form of violence, albeit a non-physical one.  The intensity of the description might trigger flags depending on the platform's algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Would it be flagged?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The likelihood of this post being flagged depends heavily on the specific content moderation system used.  A system with a stricter approach to violence and hate speech, even in contextual situations, would likely flag it. A system focusing primarily on explicit keywords might miss some of the more subtle issues.  Platforms prioritizing user safety are more likely to err on the side of caution and flag the post for review by a human moderator.\n",
      "\n",
