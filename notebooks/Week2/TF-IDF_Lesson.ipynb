    "# Implementing TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF, short for **term frequency‚Äìinverse document frequency**, is a metric that reflects how important a word is to a **document** in a collection or **corpus**. When talking about text datasets, the dataset is called a corpus, and each datapoint is a document. A document can be a post, a paragraph, a webpage, whatever is considered the individual unit of text for a given datset. A **term** is each unique token in a document (we previously also referred to this as **type**). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example in a corpus of sentences, a document might be: `\"I went to New York City in New York state.\"` \n",
    "\n",
    "The processed tokens in that document might be: `[went, new_york, city, new_york, state]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The document would have four unique terms: `[went, new_york, city, state]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document (the term frequency, or TF), and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word (the inverse document frequency, or IDF). This helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general ‚Äì such as articles and prepositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't go into much detail about the math behind calculating the TF-IDF (see the D-Lab Text Analysis workshop videos to see more). The key components to remember are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is one TF-IDF score per unique word and unique document.\n",
    "2. A high TF-IDF score suggests that word is descriptive of that document.\n",
    "3. A low TF-IDF score may be because either the word is not frequent in that document, or that it is frequent in many documents in the dataset - either way, it may not be a good descriptor of that document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that if a word occurs many times in one post but rarely in the rest of the corpus, it is probably useful for characterizing that post; conversely, if a word occurs frequently in a post but also occurs frequently in the corpus, it is probably less characteristic of that post."

      "\n",
      "Buckle up. This is probably going to be a long one.... if you make it through all of this you are my hero. \n",
      "\n",
      "At first he was supposed to come over just for a few hours on Wednesday nights to play guitar with my husband while I was at work. Over time I have stopped working late Wednesday‚Äôs but the jam session continues. Which was fine. However, for the last year they have barely touched the guitars and instead the guy just comes over to get high (on pot). Neither my husband or I get high with him (I don‚Äôt enjoy pot and my husband isn‚Äôt much into it either, but we aren‚Äôt morally against it so we didn‚Äôt say anything early on when we should have). \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that he is always high here, he NEVER leaves at the end of the night. Just expects to sleep over. But he doesn‚Äôt have a regular sleep schedule so instead of sleeping while we are, he is wandering around our house all night (in his boxers) making noises, watching tv, getting nonstop text alerts from other friends and ect. This always wakes me up and I have to pass by him on the way to the bathroom. At these points he always has demands. Like: ‚ÄúI want to watch this random movie your husband said you had. Find it for me.‚Äù Or ‚Äúyou need to change your litter box right now, because your cat just pooped and I can‚Äôt stand the smell.‚Äù He always says he‚Äôll leave when my husband goes for work at 8am, but then complains that he couldn‚Äôt sleep until 6am, so he ends up sleeping until mid day. At which point he just decides to stay until my husband gets home from work and then the whole thing starts over again. What‚Äôs supposed to be one night a week often turns into at least two every week. \n",
      "\n",
      "On top of never leaving, he has started showing up HOURS before my husband gets off work on Wednesday‚Äôs. My husband has told him ‚Äúmy home is your home‚Äù so he just comes right in. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if he could self entertain. But no. He comes in and will just walk into our bedroom (where I‚Äôm hiding) sit down on the bed, take a hit of his shit, and start talking to me through whatever I‚Äôm doing/watching on tv. \n",
      "\n",
      "Every time he is here he eats A LOT of our food (gets the munchies, plus regular meals) but never once has had the courtesy to bring anything of his own, or to share, or to replace what he is eating here. He just goes into our fridge and pantry and eats whatever he wants because my husband told him our home was his. \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband is always begging me to be nice and not say anything while he is here because he is lonely and needs friends.... except he has his other best friend living with him, and is constantly going on weekend trips all over the country to visit his other friends.  Not to mention those nonstop text message alerts all night. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dealing with this guy is like hanging out with a 17 year old stoner non stop. He farts and burps as loud as possible wherever. Whenever. Is demanding and needy, but completely rude at the same time. Saying things like ‚Äúdude! You actually made your house look SORTA nice this week.‚Äù (As I was prepping for Christmas), and ‚Äúso you do sometimes make an effort on your looks‚Äù (when I had gone somewhere nice and come home with makeup on). He also complains non stop about the food I make (yet eats it all anyway). \n",
      "\n",
      "This year for my birthday we couldn‚Äôt afford to get any gifts, so I asked my husband instead to line up his days off so we could spend four days just us together...... then this guy broke up with his girlfriend and my husband begged me to let him come over just for a bit on the first evening. Que TWO full weeks of him not going home, and demanding all of my husband‚Äôs time. I spent ‚Äúour time‚Äù and my birthday, holed up in our room alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, Christmas comes. I had invited my whole family to our house and tried to make things extra special because it was the first time I got to see my parents on Christmas in more than ten years. This guy‚Äôs mom had just moved to another state BUT this guy has plenty of money and no job to work around so he could have easily made the trip to her for Christmas. But he didn‚Äôt. Then his other friend/housemate also went out of town and he threw a ‚Äúwoe is me, I‚Äôm all alone one Christmas Eve, no one loves me‚Äù tantrum until my husband invited him to our house. He shows up. Gets high. And is a complete ass to everyone. Then throws a fit when he decides to sleep over because he has to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag (my family were in the other beds.) the next morning we sit down to breakfast and he lets out this HUGE stinky fart right at the table like it‚Äôs nothing, then proceeds to dish himself up 90% of the food and just generally be a douche. My family was flat out disgusted by him and his behavior and couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. He stayed for three days. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like an ass hole because he is my husband‚Äôs best friend and I don‚Äôt want to make them not hang out, and honestly he hasn‚Äôt done anything truly terrible. He‚Äôs just annoying as shit. I fucking dread every Wednesday, and then I‚Äôm super irritated the whole time he‚Äôs here. Which I hide from him, at my husband‚Äôs request, but then my husband and I always end up fighting over him not leaving at the end of the night. \n",

His friend has been in my husband‚Äôs life since he was in grade school, and while the friend is over they do actively chat, watch movies, and generally hang out while I actively hide and feel irritated. All this stuff for sure could look like an exaggeration if it all happened in the last few days, but this is sorta my laundry list of the last two years of grievances which have been building up over time. On a regular Wednesday he is just stoned, flatulent, and childish, which while annoying, isn‚Äôt really actively douchy. He has done some very nice things for my husband, such as paying to take him to some very expensive concerts so that they could both nerd out over their favorite guitar players Live. I -clearly- don‚Äôt like the guy, but my husband gets a lot of enjoyment out of their friendship and I‚Äôm not saying that has to stop. Just that -I- need a break. Also, my husband DOES have other friends, they just have lives so he only gets to hang out once every few months with them. He is also in a band with other friends whom he sees regularly every Monday night. \n",
      "\n",
      "Clarification 3: My husband doesn‚Äôt see a problem with how he speaks to me because according to him ‚Äúthe guy just has poor social skills, that comment about your makeup was a compliment.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "Clarification 4: He smokes a vape style pot pen, not a physical bud, which has less residual scent and is why my husband told him he could do it in the house. Before he started using I was ok with him. He still had poor manners, but he wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as he is now, and he never spent the night (or longer). Back before the pot I even enjoyed hanging out with the two of them every so often. Oh and I KNOW my husband occasionally also imbibes with him, which isn‚Äôt something that makes me mad. He doesn‚Äôt go overboard like his friend. \n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: When I woke up this morning I noticed that my phone was buzzing‚Ä¶. And buzzing‚Ä¶. And buzzing‚Ä¶. As all these awesome comments kept pouring in. I have never really had much success on Reddit, so when I looked and saw how many comments there were I said ‚ÄúOh My GoD!‚Äù Of course my husband asked what was wrong and I said ‚ÄúI told the internet the story of ***** and asked if I was the ass hole for what we fought over last night.‚Äù He said..‚ÄùOh‚Äù and that was it. BUT then on his way out of the bedroom he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get him up‚Äù, and by the time I was dressed and out of the room they guy was out of the house and driving away. Hallelujah!!! \n",
      "\n",
      "Forty minutes later when he got to work I received a text message telling me how I was his best friend and that he loves me more than the world ect. Then we texted back and forth and he said ‚ÄúI really feel like we both contribute to it. I feel like you are overly grumpy on things pertaining to *****. But at the same time, I invite him to come up extra days, or stay the night without running it by you. I feel we could both do better and relieve a lot of stress and frustration. Do you agree?‚Äù  \n",
      "\n",
      "He then called a few minutes later and I told him that I know I‚Äôm grumpy but I feel like it‚Äôs reasonably so. I also told him I didn‚Äôt want to force them not to be friends just that -I- needed a break from the friend. Then I gave him some possible solutions such as hanging out at his house every other week, or have a set time that the guy needs to stop smoking in order to drive home later (thanks guys! Great suggestions!) and he agreed to consider other arrangements with the hang out time so that I could have some time away from the friend, and we agreed to talk more about it when he is off work tonight. Although I can tell he STILL isn‚Äôt seeing a problem other than my attitude : / \n",
