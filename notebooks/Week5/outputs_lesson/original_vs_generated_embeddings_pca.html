The three of us split rent and utilities equally. We all have a similar cleanliness level and a general rule of clean up after yourself. Everyone does their own laundry, keeps their bedrooms tidy, and the common spaces like the livingroom and kitchen get cleaned regularly by all of us.

At first I would oblige. I thought \"Whatever, it will only take a few seconds, NBD\". But as it happens more and more, I'm starting to realize not everyone is being asked to do this.
