    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are machine learning systems trained to predict the next word in a sequence of text. They‚Äôre called ‚Äúlarge‚Äù because they‚Äôre built using massive amounts of text data and contain billions of parameters‚Äîtunable weights that determine the model‚Äôs behavior.\n",

    "LLMs learn patterns in language by analyzing word sequences, grammar, facts, and even writing styles from their training data. Rather than memorizing specific phrases, they build a statistical understanding of how language works. This allows them to generate surprisingly fluent and coherent text, answer questions, summarize content, and more."

    "# What is GPT-2?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)**, developed by OpenAI, is a well-known example of an LLM. It‚Äôs trained on a broad dataset from the internet and can generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"GPT\" Stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. *Generative*, because it generates text. Pre-trained, because it has been trained on a massive amount of data, and \"pre\" insinuates one could further train, or **finetune**, this model. A *transformer* is a specific kind of neural network. You can build different models from transformer architecture; the training goal of GPT is to take in a piece of text, and produce a prediction of what comes next in the passage.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 is a model from 2019. It was trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. In this notebook, we are using GPT-2 Small, the base model, which has only (!) 117 million parameters (for comparison, GPT-2 XL has 1.5 billion parameters, and GPT4 has 175 *billion*). A \"parameter\" is an adjustable internal value that the model learns and uses to make predictions or generate text based on its input. More parameters usually means a \"smarter\", more capable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this smaller model to make it possible to finetune it on a local computer (although you still need a pretty recent machine to run the code in this notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is fine-tuning?\n",
    "Fine-tuning GPT-2 on a specific dataset, like our r/amitheasshole dataset, customizes the model's responses to reflect the themes, style, language, or idioms found within that corpus. This process tailors the model's generative capabilities, making it more likely to produce outputs that are stylistically and thematically aligned with the fine-tuning material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's adaptation will be more pronounced when generating text related to or prompted by the domain we train it on. This might include specific narrative styles, dialogue structures, and  conventions unique to Am I The Asshole.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weight Adjustment\n",
    "Fine-tuning adjusts the weights of the neural network to minimize the loss on the new data. The changes in weights help the model better predict or generate sequences that resemble the fine-tuning data."

    "Time to start the finetuning process. We first load in our r/aita dataset and initialize a tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tokenizer performs several critical tasks to convert raw text into a format that the GPT-2 model can understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splitting Text into Tokens: The tokenizer breaks down input text into tokens. For GPT-2, these tokens are usually subwords or characters, allowing the model to handle a wide range of words and vocabularies efficiently.\n",
    "- Converting Tokens to IDs: Each token is mapped to a unique integer ID based on the GPT-2 vocabulary. This conversion is necessary because neural networks operate on numerical data, not raw text.\n",
    "- Adding Special Tokens: GPT-2 requires certain special tokens for its operation (e.g., end-of-text token). The tokenizer takes care of adding these tokens where appropriate.\n",
    "- Padding & Truncation: To process batches of data efficiently, all input sequences must be of the same length. The tokenizer can pad shorter sequences with a special padding token or truncate longer ones to a maximum length.\n",
    "- Creating Attention Masks: The tokenizer generates attention masks to differentiate real tokens from padding tokens. This helps the model pay attention to relevant tokens and ignore padded areas."

       "['My girlfriend recently went to the beach with a few of her friends.  She has this tiny bikini bottom that is basically a thong that I HATE when she wears in public.  Well she wore it.  Not only did she wear it, she posed in the bathroom mirror of her hotel room to take a side profile picture so you could see her ass sticking out in it and posted it to her Snapchat story.   Worth mentioning I am not friends with her on Snapchat for reasons similar to this (sick of getting in fights when she says she\\'s going out for \\'girls\\' night then posts videos of her sitting at a table with like 5 dudes that always got invited by one of the other girls which was completely unknown to her until she arrived - most of these guys she then adds on Snapchat afterwards).  She didn\\'t even save it and send it to me.  I saw it when she was showing me pics from her beach trip and she had screenshot that particular snap and left it in her camera roll.  Whether the ass part was intentional or not I will never know.  She claims she just liked the way her stomach looked and it was just a pic because she was at the beach and that was the only black bikini bottom she owns.  But there\\'s nothing to look at but her in a micro bikini in a bathroom mirror.  There\\'s no ocean, no sand, no friends, just her tits and ass in a bathroom mirror.  She\\'s 24 and I am 30.  Is it the age?  Is this typical 24 year old behavior nowadays?  Am I wrong for thinking this is inappropriate behavior when you\\'re in a relationship or am I the asshole for making a big deal about it?\\n\\n\\n**Edit:**  Guys, let me clear.  I did not try to control her at any point in time.  I have never once told her what to do, what to wear, what she can or can not do.  Yes, I hate that her ass is completely out in that bikini.  But I\\'ve never told her not to wear it and my problem is not that she wore it in general.  She wore it all summer long despite my groaning.  That was never my issue.  I found it super annoying yes but my issue is that she sent out a picture of her ass on Snapchat.  Plain and simple.  That\\'s where I drew the line.  I didn\\'t break it off because she wore it, I broke it off because she turned sideways in a bathroom mirror stuck her butt out, took a picture and sent it out on Snapchat.  It\\'s a borderline nude in that suit and seems wildly inappropriate to me.  Also for clarity I am not jealous.  The friends she went to the beach with were guy friends.  I was completely ok with it.  I had never even met them before.   She has guy friends.  She hangs out with them.  Never my issue and I didn\\'t even feel it was worth mentioning.  My issue with the whole girls night comes into play when I get explicitly told I cannot come because it is girls only night, then later find out it was just a bunch of dudes and her and her girlfriend.  That\\'s not a trust thing and I didn\\'t try to make a big deal about it I just removed her from my friends on Snapchat so I didn\\'t have to see it anymore.  And in all honesty my only true problem with it was one guy that was there in particular.  He\\'s been hitting on her and messaging her non stop since we started dating knowing she has a boyfriend.  Both times I got snubbed for \\'girls night\\', this one particular fella was in attendance both nights and I got the \"I didn\\'t know he was going to be there\" from her.  But again whatever she can do whatever she wants whenever she wants and I\\'ve never tried to stop her but for my own sanity I removed her from Snapchat so I didn\\'t have to see it.  That wasn\\'t the point in this post and that wasn\\'t even why I dumped her so I didn\\'t really want to get into detail on that but a few people are calling me controlling and jealous now.  I broke it off because she sent out a pic of her ass on Snapchat.  The only reason we were together is because SHE told me the wild party phase was done and she was looking to start a family and have a serious relationship.  She is a single mom of an almost 3 year old daughter who I love to pieces.  She has been chasing me for 2 years trying to date me and I told her no every step of the way because she was just a little to wild for what I\\'m looking for in the stage I\\'m at in life.  So when she came to me earlier this year saying she had matured, all the partying and wild stuff was done and she was ready to get serious and start a family with me, I agreed to commit.  I did not date this woman and say \"HEY PUT ON SOME PANTS\".  I simply said \"you told me this stuff was over and I told you from the very beginning I had no interest in dating a girl who\\'s still stuck in the wild college party phase\" so I ended it.  If she hadn\\'t told me she had matured and wanted to get serious I never would have agreed to date her to begin with.  That\\'s just not what I\\'m looking for.  I don\\'t think that makes me jealous or controlling.  I was very open and honest about what I was looking for the 2 years I\\'ve known her.  ',\n",
       " 'My parents smoke like chimneys. I used to as well but quit when my wife and I got together. We have a young son and I‚Äôve been taking vacation time this last week, and invited my parents to come visit so they could watch our son and my wife and I could go on a date. They live an hour and a half away so sometimes they spend the night when they come visit, on this occasion they did. \\n\\nI told them beforehand, and have reminded them many times since our son was born 14 months ago, that there is absolutely no smoking at our address. Not inside, not outside, not in the street, not in their car in the driveway, not anywhere near our property. I don‚Äôt want it around my son and I don‚Äôt want him asking questions about it when he gets bigger or getting ideas, and they know that. They said okay. \\n\\nWell this morning after they left I was reviewing the footage from our security camera at the front door, and I see my dad step out into the driveway to smoke 4 times in the 3 hours my wife and I were gone. My mom did so as well but only once. I texted my dad afterward and told him that because they disrespected our wishes for them not to smoke on our property, from now on we‚Äôll only be meeting in public, they won‚Äôt be coming to our house. He asked where they would stay if they want to stay overnight, and I said in a hotel, if they‚Äôd rather smoke than see their grandson. \\n\\nMy parents basically think I‚Äôm being ridiculous, they smoked around me and my two brothers and we‚Äôre all fine. That‚Äôs actually not true, my youngest brother has asthma and had chronic ear infections as a kid that I‚Äôm sure were exacerbated by the smoking, plus I picked it up when I was only 16 and it took me years to quit. They said they would never put their grandson in danger and there was an air of ‚Äòthis is the thanks we get for babysitting?‚Äô To me, them babysitting for a few hours doesn‚Äôt give them carte blanche to disrespect me and my wife‚Äôs wishes. \\n\\nBut they‚Äôre making such a big deal out of this that I‚Äôm wondering if I was too harsh. The rule still stands, but maybe I should‚Äôve been nicer?',\n",
       " \"Hi guys. Throwaway for obv reasons.\\n\\nI'm a female and myself and two children belong to a pool club in our area.\\n\\nThere is a man, about 30ish looking, that wears bikini bathing suits and thongs to the pool. His penis is clearly bulging through his swimwear and he seems to walk around like he owns the place.\\n\\nI find this extremely creepy especially because my children and all the other families have to put up with this. Why can't this pervert just wear a normal swim trunk like every other American guy does.\\n\\nAm I in the wrong for thinking this way? I tried complaining to the pool supervisor but he said that there's nothing he can do and that he is sorry but he has every right to be there and where what he is wearing. I disagree. It's not OK for you to be walking around in tight bathing suits with your dick bulging through. WTF kind of creep does this.\\n\\nAlso, this man likes to walk around the pool deck just willy nilly, clearly looking for attention and validation. When he isn't walking around, he is laying spread eagle on the deck chairs showing off his junk. No thanks I don't want to look at this! If I am this scarred by it lol then I can't imagine what the kids must think. Isn't this borderline pedo activity? I noticed he also seems to pick a pool deck near families, so that makes us and the other families extremely uncomfortable.\\n\\nI‚Äôve also noticed that he seems to get elections which then my kids end up staring at and then I have to explain to them why men are such creeps. I realize this may be a legit medical issue but wtf if that‚Äôs the case wear swim trunks?\\n\\nHe also seems to get erections often and that is extremely difficult for me to have to explain to my children why a man is turned on in front of them.\\n\\n* EDIT: spoke with the front desk clerk and she stated that they can‚Äôt disclose any personal information about their members like the times they arrive and leave because of the potential for stalking. I guess I‚Äôll prob have to just deal with it and tell my children that penises drip precum and that some men make more than others and that it‚Äôs ok for them to just hang out with a hard ok letting their precum stain the entire front side of their man-kini.

       " 'My wife and I are vegetarians, much to my in-laws vocal annoyance. Last year, we visited her family for Thanksgiving, and to their credit they made sure there were enough yummy vegetarian side dishes that we could fill out plates with more than just mashed potatoes.\\n\\nOn that same trip, my wife\\'s mom invited themselves to our place for Thanksgiving this year. \"I think it\\'s your turn to host us.\" I said that sounded like fun. (It did and does.) \"But,\" she said, \"You\\'ll be cooking us a turkey.\" I sort of laughed and said, well, no. It became an **issue**. We argued. I said that we would make such a wonderful dinner and they would have such a nice time that they wouldn\\'t even miss the turkey. She said that we were being selfish.\\n\\nNow that Thanksgiving is approaching, I feel pressure to just make the damn turkey so it doesn\\'t come up.

They live several states away and the hassle and cost of traveling is much higher than hosting (for me). So while it was a little odd to have her invite herself over, I don\\'t at all object to hosting them.\\n\\nEDIT2: A few more details: We\\'ve been vegetarian for a little over 2 years. I\\'ve cooked a turkey one time several years ago, but I\\'m sure my wife has done it a handful of times.',\n",

       " \"I met this girl a couple of weeks back in a pub. She's really cute and I thought we were hitting it off really well. We kissed that night, and I got her number. We met up on nights out a couple of times after that, but she never seemed like she was into me so much, as if the kiss was just a bit of fun. Honestly I didn't mind, I wasn't after anything serious and she was still a lot of fun to be around.\\n\\nHe friends told me she is just a really flirty person and is like that with everybody. Anyway, the second time I kissed her we were at a bar, and when we left she stayed at my flat because it was late and my flat was a lot closer.\\n\\nI tried to make a move again when she was in my flat but she pulled away and then outright said 'I don't want to have sex with you'. So we just snuggled up together and watched cartoons on netflix. I brought out some alcohol from the kitchen and we kept drinking - honestly I wasn't trying to get her drunk, but we both did get really drunk. And I don't really know how it happened, but we were both kissing each other again, and then we went to my room and had sex - and I definitely used a condom.\\n\\nIn the morning she woke up and started freaking out. It turned out she didn't remember having sex with me and didn't know why she was naked in bed with me. She was visibly scared and asked if we had had sex. I said we had and she got really angry, saying that I should not have taken advantage of her when she was drunk. It turns out she only had sex with people after they have an std test but I didn't know that, and I assured her that we used a condom because unlike her I remembered the night.\\n\\nI told her the truth, that it was consensual the whole way through and she was visibly enjoying it, but this just made her even more mad and she just left and won't talk to me again. I'm sure she's told all her friends I raped her, but as far as I know she hasn't gone to the police.\\n\\nI spoke with one of my close friends about it, expecting her to understand, but she said what I did WAS rape, even if I didn't realise it at the time. She said she knew I didn't mean any harm, but I should have known better. I know she never outright verbally consented to having sex with me - in fact she said the exact opposite - but the fact that she did eventually choose to have sex with me, despite being drunk, surely means this wasn't rape?\\n\\nI'm really stressed out about the whole matter and I hope the police don't get involved. And I know she must have been freaked out to wake up naked in bed with me, but I honestly don't think I did anything wrong!\",\n",

I wasn\\'t that keen to stay up so I took myself upstairs and went to bed.  \\n\\nAbout half an hour later, I needed to come down for a glass of water and as I walked in there was a huge commotion.

That is f***ing disgusting!*\" etc. This caused us to both start going off at each other, and her defense was \"*It\\'s no different than cutting up salmon on a chopping board*\" (not to mention this is a freshwater tank and was quite murky with algae at the time).   \\n\\n\\nMost of the friends there at the time think I overreacted (they thought it was funny) and in hindsight I probably could have handled the situation better if I had not raised my voice.  \\n\\n\\nI just want some other opinions, AITA in this situation?  \\n\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Housemate\\'s girlfriend chopped \"pet\" fish alive with my chopping board and knife and fed to the other fish, I yelled at her, she got defensive, friends think I overreacted.\\n\\n**EDIT/UPDATE:** Thanks everyone. Just a bit of background for anyone interested.. This actually happened a couple of months ago but is something that I have pondered over since. \\n\\nHousemate and The Slaughterer have actually been in an off-and-on relationship since the incident, and thankfully she hasn\\'t stepped foot in the house while I\\'ve been there (rightly so). The fish tank itself is not mine (it\\'s my housemate\\'s 8ft x 2ft x 2ft - so it\\'s huge) but I have purchased several fish to add to it and also contribute to the maintenance i.e. cleaning, feeding etc. The fish in question was not my fish, but that\\'s beside the point in my opinion.

When it came to our friend group, my ex was the popular one, so when we broke up I lost contact with a lot of them & only one of them actually said something outright to me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs for the actual breaking up itself: The entire conversation was done over text, and while I wasn\\'t as soft as I probably could have been, I don\\'t think I was an outright dick to her or anything. I was a stupid kid, but not a malicious one; any assholishness in the actual text itself was unintentional, because I was (and still am) very bad at talking to people.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs for the people saying that we could have talked about an open relationship or something along those lines: She would have shut that down in an instant, and honestly I don\\'t think I\\'d want one anyway. I\\'m not one for polyamorous relationships; but then again I\\'ve never tried it and they always say don\\'t knock it \\'till you\\'ve tried it, lol.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs for the people calling her an asshole for not volunteering the information: Honestly?

       " 'This might be a bit long, so I\\'m sorry in advance. \\n\\n\\nThis whole episode went down about a year ago. Basically, I was doing an exchange program at a college in Japan. The classes were all co educational with Japanese and foreign students. My program only had about 35 or so people, so almost everyone was on a first name basis with each other and we were a fairly tight knit group. \\n\\n\\n Because of this, we often had class parties where everyone hung out and talked/drank/etc... At one of these parties, I noticed that one of my female Japanese friends was being cornered and forced to talk with another American exchange student, and was looking a little bit uncomfortable. I went over and asked her if she could go help me get more drinks from the supermarket, and she used the excuse to hurry out of there. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom now on, I\\'m going to call this dickhead \"D\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI was hoping this would be a one and done thing, but in the following days I noticed that my friend seemed a little on edge around D. One day, I pretty much layed it out and asked her if the incident at the party was bothering her and if there was anything I could do about it. She confided in me that D had also been begging her to date him, sending her explicit messages about what he would \"do to her\", and messaging her dick pics even after she asked him to stop. Apparently that party wasn\\'t the first time he\\'d cornered her either, and he had a pretty significant size advantage on her too, so It was easy to see why she was so intimidated. \\n\\n\\n\\nAfter she told me all that, I gotta admit, I was pretty furious. I urged her to report that kind of thing to the dean, or the police, but she told that she did not want to tell the adminstrators or authorities about it. While I\\'m no expert on Japanese culture or criminal procedure, but she made it sound like there was a significant chance she might get brushed off or not believed if she escalated it. Plus once word got back to D, she might have a pissed off white guy on her ass with 50 pounds and a foot on her. \\n\\n\\n\\nNormally I\\'m a goody two shoes, but at that point I was willing to do anything short of an ass beating (had to think of my Visa) to get back at this asshole. My chance came a few weeks later, when I got invited to a gaming discord group with some of the other guys from my program, including D. I was reading back in old chats, because I was still trying to read up on this guy. Concincidentally, I happened upon an exchange where him and the other guys were joking around by messaging each other weird porn in the chat. It was mostly pretty ridiculous stuff, like that spider porn video and shit like that, until I spotted it: in the chat D had posted a picture of \"lolicon\" hentai (drawn child porn for those who don\\'t know). I screenshotted it fast and saved it on my computer.\\n\\n\\n\\nI debated back and forth for a while, but eventually I did it. I cropped the screenshot I had taken of D\\'s \"lolicon\" message and uploaded it on social media. When I posted it, I cut off the joking context, and essentially painted D as a bona fide pedophile and myself as a \"whistleblower\" so to speak. I thought that everyone would look at him weird and whisper behind his back, and that it would humilate him but eventually blow over. I was dead wrong on that.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy post \"blew up\" about as much as it could have in a social media group with less than 100 people. I had a reputation as being good student and pretty serious guy, so a lot of people took my post at face value. Apparently, I also wasn\\'t the only one with a bone to pick with D, and soon a bunch of people had come forwards with accounts of him being creepy or harrassing them.

We are super cool mates. I was looking for one night stands at the time so I'm going about on tinder, when I met this woman (I'm into older women keep in mind) so we chat for a bit, flirt for a couple days, next thing you know we are going out on our first date so I take her to dinner at a nice restaurant, i played for the meals and everything, she got quite tipsy on some wine, but i was still sober. So i pay the bill, take her into my car and she tells me where her place is so I ride over there, she opens the door, and we go into the bedroom, and have sex. So fast foward a couple of days im finishing my workout with my mate Tim. And he invites me over to play some Xbox, so I ride over to his place to the first time, and my heart sank, Its the same house of the woman I had a one night stand with. My legs are shaking and I enter inside, thank god she isn't there. So we sit on the couch and start playing Xbox, when Tim asks me to go pass him a Gatorade from the fridge. So I go up to the fridge and see pictures of him and his family, and it turns out the woman i had sex with was his mother... So I quickly grab a Gatorade for him, and i go back and we play Xbox. I haven't said a word about the situation about me and his mom. Im afraid it will ruin our friendship. Should i Tell him about it? AITA?\",\n",
       " \"Pretty much says it in the title; whenever I initiate sex with my gf she winces in pain and says it's uncomfortable. Yet whenever she is up for it there seems to be no pain issue at all. \\n\\nLast night we were fooling around and I got her to orgasm through foreplay - zero issues or pain. I was pretty into it and initiated sex and instantly she was uncomfortable, despite me slowing down the pace. Finally after one thrust she yelled out in pain pretty much directly in my face which was the final straw for me. This has been happening for so long now yet she never does anything about it and tbh I doubt there is any pain - and if there is then she seems to be exaggerating it way out of proportion. I know that people will say no vagina, no opinion; but I know for a fact that I wasn't being forceful or rough so to downright scream in my face was totally unnecessary. \\n\\nShe has no other symptoms or discomfort aside from this, and like I said if she initiates then miraculously there's no problem. It's not a lube thing either, trust me I've tried that too. \\n\\nI guess the reason I'm asking is because last night we kinda had a big fight about it. I lost my cool and told her how huge a turn off it is to see her face screwed up in pain all the time, and how I didnt think the pain was as bad as she was making out. I told her that sex was becoming really boring and I could pretty much predict how it would go each time. I also said the only solution  at this point was just to not have sex. She called me an asshole and went on the offensive. Said I have two moves and yet I expect her to be like a 'porn star'. \\n\\nSo am I the asshole?

There was a credit card in my name with an address to my mother\\'s house. It had a max of $2,000 and a little over $1,000 on the balance and most of the payments over the last two years were at least 30 days late, some were 90 days late. Needless to say I was shocked.

       " 'Before any of you start freaking out at me, I want to say that I fully support both women and men asking for consent before getting touchy or sexual with another person, and I would never in my life think about treating another person that way. Now that thats out of the way, the AITA moment.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been with my girlfriend for the last 8\\\\~ months.  In this time, we\\'ve slept together, been sexual together, and all that jazz.  We\\'ve hit a comfortable routine where on friday nights one of us would go to the others place and spend the weekend there.  Our usual routine on the first night is watching some shitty movie or tv show until we realize we don\\'t actually care what we\\'re watching and would much rather make out.  This goes on until one of us decides to start pawing at each others genitals like a cat pawing the bottom of the door while you\\'re trying to use the bathroom.  Things lead into foreplay followed by the usual sex times.   This has been our almost weekly routine for a good 3 months now.  We\\'ve been comfortable with each other and very open about our sexual desires and what not.\\n\\nNow, on this last friday, I went over to her apartment.  We put on some stupid netflix documentary that I can\\'t remember the name of, and about half way through we started tongue boxing.  I got into it, and decided to start touching her, resulting in me getting under her pants.  I do the business and make her feel good.  After this, we just sit there for a minute in the after glow, before she pulls away from me and goes kind of silent.  I try to talk to her because I can tell somethings suddenly upset her but have no idea what, she tries to tell me that nothings wrong.  I tell her that I know when shes upset and if she\\'s not willing to talk with me about it then I should probably just go, so she breaks down and says this.\\n\\n\"I just feel like you kind of use me.  You never ask for my consent before touching me and it makes me feel like an object instead of a person.\"\\n\\nNow, of course I understand the sentiment.  I\\'m not always the most romantic of person, I try to make her feel good and give 110% to her, but I can see where shes coming from.  Still, I was \\\\[visibly confused\\\\] at this statement, and she must have noticed because she huffed and pulled away again and said that I never listen to her.\\n\\nI point out how we\\'ve been dating for months, and that neither of us has asked for consent to touch the other since we first started dating and were just starting to be sexual towards one another.  She gets mad at this and says how it isn\\'t the same for a woman as it is a man.  I tell her how blatantly a double standard that is.  \\n\\nAt this point shes getting angry and borderline yelling at me about this, and says that I\\'m no longer allowed to touch her in any way unless I ask first and she gives me permission.\\n\\nI say that it makes no sense for us to be dating and in a romantic relationship if she expects me to walk on eggshells just to try and be intimate with her, and say that shes making me feel like I\\'m some kind of molester or sexual offender because I want to touch the woman I\\'ve been dating for 8 months.\\n\\n\"Well maybe you are!\" she says angrily.  At this point, I\\'m angry, annoyed, and absolutely fed up.  I just say that if thats the way things need to be with her then maybe we just should break up.  She throws a fit over this and starts insulting me, at which time I just leave and go home.\\n\\nNot five minutes after I walk in my door, shes texting me saying that shes sorry for insulting me and yelling at me, I think it over for a minute and decide that I\\'m done, text her back that we\\'re through, and go to bed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI woke up in the morning to almost 50 texts, most from her either being apologetic or angry, the rest being from friends of hers or her sister calling me an asshole because I \"broke up with the perfect woman because I wasn\\'t allowed to grope her whenever I want.\"\\n\\nSo, Am I the asshole here?  I feel like I\\'m justified in my reaction and opinions regarding this, but at the same time feel like maybe theres some new wave promoting the virtue of consent that I\\'ve missed?  Am I the asshole for thinking that you shouldn\\'t need to ask for consent to touch or feel your partner if you\\'re in a romantic relationship?  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd before you start yelling at me (even though I\\'m sure half of you have already started typing) I respect a persons right to say no.  If I touch my girlfriend, or any girl I\\'m with sexually/romantically for that matter, and they say they aren\\'t interested or aren\\'t in the mood, I\\'ll stop, no question.

       " 'There are a lot of moving parts to this story, but here‚Äôs a brief backstory. \\n\\nEvery year since I was a child thanksgiving has been held at grandmas. In 2012 my step uncle took advantage of me being blacked out drunk, came into the room I was passed out in, and molested me. Took years to get over it. My whole family still talks to him. As if it never happened. Pretty sure no one believes me. This man lives in another state. \\n\\nSo fast forward to this year and a week before thanksgiving grandma calls to give me a heads up that this man will be in town this year. So obviously, myself and my husband and two kids won‚Äôt be going. I am the one who has to rearrange my plans, my family has to miss out. Not him. Which I think is just mind blowing... but moving forward. \\n\\nMy mom is torn. She feels bad for grandma but also wants to see me and her grandkids. So she decided to hold thanksgiving at her boyfriends house for her immediate family. She tells me to be there at 5, but that I can come over whenever. I‚Äôm tasked with desserts so I spend my day baking pies and wrangling my twins to get everyone ready. \\n\\nWe arrive at 5:30ish. Late as usual. It‚Äôs a kid thing. Things are going great. Food is delicious. We decided to play cards against humanity and I leave to run home and grab it really quick. While I‚Äôm gone husband calls to say my mom, sister, brother, and the boyfriend and left to grandmas but will be back soon. TWO god damn hours pass and they still aren‚Äôt back. They‚Äôve been gone longer then they were there meanwhile we are in this house with two other people we don‚Äôt really know. The roommate of the boyfriend and another girl. I‚Äôm furious. \\n\\nSo I decided we are leaving. I pack everyone up and text my mom as we get in the car and she says they are almost there. She also sends another text that was a little garbeled but said that I‚Äôm not leaving because we are going to get.. and I quote, ‚Äútore up from the floor up.‚Äù Let that sink in for a minuet. My MOM, who has never said that in her life, is speaking to me like a 17 year old thot. What in the actual fuck? So they show up and she is wasted. We are all outside and I say three times we are leaving just because I want to go. She pushes for an answer and I blow up. I tell her it‚Äôs complete bullshit she left in the middle of OUR thanksgiving to go to grandmas. Like why didn‚Äôt she go earlier in the day?? It‚Äôs bullshit that she assumes I‚Äôd want to get drunk on this day. I don‚Äôt drink on thanksgiving. I haven‚Äôt since 2012 because I CANT. I‚Äôm always the DD and I prefer it that way. Too much anxiety. \\n\\nMy bitch ass sister decided to pipe up and says ‚Äúbut we moved thanksgiving for you!‚Äù And that‚Äôs where shit hit the fan. I didn‚Äôt ASK for that. I asked to see them in a different day. They didn‚Äôt move thanksgiving FOR me, they moved it BECAUSE of me. Because it‚Äôs awkward for everyone apparently. I hear my sister loudly apologize to her boyfriend for having to witness such a monstrosity as her black sheep sister, and I get in the car. We drive away and I haven‚Äôt heard from my family since. I ruined everyone‚Äôs thanksgiving. I feel extremely angry at my family, but I also feel guilt. I have no idea why. AITA? \\n\\nEdit 1: spelling. Sorry, on mobile and type all angry and fast to get it out. \\n\\nEdit 2: Holy Support! First off, to all of those who suspect karma farming, I promise you that is not the case. I don‚Äôt have much karma. This is my very first post that has done this, and I didn‚Äôt intend for it to. Secondly, trauma guilt is a thing. I wish I would have posted the issue with my uncle and family years ago. It would have saved me a lot of questioning my own sanity. I feel validated, yes! But I came here to check my self to make sure I wasn‚Äôt actually the asshole. Because it wasn‚Äôt clear until now that I truly Am NTA! Thank you to everyone for the love and supporting comments! I needed to hear this so badly! \\n\\nEdit 3: Answer to the ‚Äúhow did you know if you were blacked out.‚Äù I posted this is in the comments but I guess after awhile people don‚Äôt read all the way down. \\n\\nQuite the personal story,  but I‚Äôm in a place I can talk about it so okay.\\n\\nThe next morning I had frames of memory that I original felt like were a dream. The whole thing is foggy. He approached me the next morning and asked me if I remembered. I said something like ‚Äúuh no‚Äù and he told me that I had sucked his dick. I told him there was no way. Literally used the line ‚Äúeven if you were Channing Tatum‚Äù there was no way. I remember that clear as day. That afternoon he left and sent me a text telling me that I better not tell anyone. That if I did we would both loose or marriages. I spent a good 4 months pretty fucked up. Going over those frames of memory, trying to make sense of it. I felt dirty. I felt like maybe I had been wrong. Maybe I didn‚Äôt remember right.\\n\\nThrough counseling those frames became a little bit clearer. I was walked through accepting what happened that night, being reminded of key details that proved to my brain that I was not at fault. Details like my husband walked me into the bedroom to put me to bed because I was drunk. He took of my shoes, tucked me in, and closed the door. I remember that. At some point this uncle open the door. Came in, uninvited. THAT is the key I hold to reminding myself I am not at fault and I should not feel dirty or guilty. Lots of therapy.\\n\\n',\n",

I got to the bar and ordered 9 or 10 shots before she got there to loosen up a bit (I tend to say inappropriate things on dates when I‚Äôm sober due to being nervous). This was around 7PM and she arrived around 8:30...in a wheelchair. Now, I want to be very clear here - nowhere in the Chat, in the tinder pictures, in our text messages was it even IMPLIED, let alone stated, that she was in a wheelchair.

I also realized that this would always be in the back of my mind if I were to date her - that her physical limitations would cause me to feel some sort of resent towards her altering my lifestyle. I mean hell, we were watching a Bama game at the bar and I felt extremely awkward after I blurted our ‚ÄúRoll Tide‚Äù, something completely innocent because I was afraid that it unknowingly offended her - it stayed in the back of my mind the entire date. Eventually I mentioned to her that I had a great time, but had church early in the morning and had to head home. I bent down and gave her a kiss but didn‚Äôt imply anything about meeting her again or continuing correspondence.

Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\\n\\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\\n\\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\\n\\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\\n\\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\\n\\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\\n\\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\\n\\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\\n\\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\\n\\nReddit.\\n\\nAITA?\",\n",

It was the last few anyways so I just bought a new pack. Until she told me she was pregnant and she did not seem surprised at all. A few weeks after that I just knew something was wrong.

I don‚Äôt want to look her in the eyes or even really talk to her.\\n\\nIt may be that because I‚Äôm autistic and have OCD tendencies, and that I‚Äôm so visually enthralled with her, that it‚Äôs just a particularity with me as a person. All I know is that when she does this I‚Äôm provoked to a sense of utter betrayal and disregard. I feel completely broken for days and quite upset for weeks. \\n\\nEvery time before, we‚Äôve talked about this and she‚Äôs empathized with me and agreed to commit to a process of consulting with the artist before hand, receiving a complete image, sleeping on it, and then deciding together whether to proceed.\\n\\nHer last two tattoos were very poorly executed because she just picked the first artist she came across/went with her family to do group tattooing, looked at the portfolio of his best work online, and went in that week to get it. On her last one they came up with additions on the spot that IMO look horrible and weren‚Äôt executed well either. She‚Äôs constantly showing me images of other people‚Äôs regrettable tattoos and stuff but when it comes to her own process she just doesn‚Äôt care and wings it every time.\\n\\nIt really severely bothers me that she‚Äôs rushing the process because her family wants to get tattoos. I feel like my concerns are being pushed aside to join in on a mob mentality that disregards prudence for the sake of a good time doing something ‚Äúrisky‚Äù together. I‚Äôm thinking about the next four or five decades together looking at tattoos that could have been really beautiful and fitting to her form but just aren‚Äôt at all, and all she seems to be thinking about is how cool it will be to go get a tattoo with her family for the second time.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs her body, and she can do what she wants at the end of the day.. but she‚Äôs the sole object of my affection. I don‚Äôt look at anybody else in the world the way I look at her, I don‚Äôt EVER let myself lust for any other woman. Nobody gets my heart, my eyes are all for her - and it breaks me that she betrays that with what seems to me to be a selfish and impulsive pattern of behavior. I can‚Äôt help but be hurt, except maybe to change my perspective. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking for input.\\n\\nFYI, I love tattoos and body mods done in good taste. We‚Äôve both agreed I‚Äôll be getting sleeves, I already have stretched ears. It‚Äôs not an aversion to tattooing.\\n\\nAlso if this seems like an overreaction to you, please resist the urge to make comments like ‚Äúchill out it‚Äôs just a tattoo‚Äù... I have extremely powerful emotions due to Asperger‚Äôs/high functioning autism and I have to consider how I‚Äôm going to feel for years to come. I can‚Äôt afford to just suppress. I‚Äôm still in pain whenever I think about her last tattoo nearly a year and a half ago.\\n\\n‚Äî\\n\\nMaybe the question is whether she‚Äôs responsible for my visual attraction to her, that the fundamental issue is whether my aesthetic taste should even be a factor. Maybe that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm the asshole. Maybe I should let her freely and permanently express herself through the exact process she enjoys and maybe it‚Äôs my responsibility to just bear with it.

I feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. \\n\\nThat said, I think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, AND MY DYING WIFE.

       " 'I was invited to judge a music talent show contest for teenage kids. There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\\n\\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\\n\\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He\\'s not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\\n\\nIt\\'s time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\\n\\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\\n\\nAt this point, Ryan\\'s mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I\\'m still an undergraduate student and I\\'m dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\\n\\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\\n\\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I\\'m feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\\n\\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan\\'s mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn\\'t think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \\n\\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You\\'re not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you\\'re just an asshole.\" I didn\\'t think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  \\n\\nEdit: Could I have given him more points? Sure. Why did I give him a 7?

       " 'A more accurate title would be: Am I The Homophobe. So here‚Äôs my situation; \\n\\nI‚Äôm an indie film Writer/Director, based in Australia. Myself and my crew have recently completed a short film, and have just launched our festival run. For this film, I was the Writer as well as Co-Director (important). It‚Äôs also worth note that our crew is full of very close friends, and there was no negativity or tension on-set.\\n\\nFor context, I‚Äôm a straight male. My Co-Director is female, and currently in a serious relationship with a woman. My Producer (male) is gay, and engaged to his partner. And my Assistant Director identifies as a lesbian. The four of us have the say on where the film is entered, festival wise.\\n\\nWithin the crew of roughly 20 people, I‚Äôd estimate that 6ish people openly identify as LGBTQ+. Like I said above, I‚Äôm the only person in one of the executive roles that is straight. \\n\\nThere‚Äôs a particular festival that caught the other threes eyes when we were shortlisting. The festival is specifically for LGBTQ+ films or filmmakers. One of the entry rules is that your film must have some kind of LGBTQ+ themes/context OR you as a filmmaker must identify as LGBTQ+. Our film has absolutely nothing in it relating to the LGBTQ+ community, and this fact is something that all four of us agree on.\\n\\nSo the only way we‚Äôd be accepted, is if the key people identify as LGBTQ+. The problem is I don‚Äôt. Now the other three are fairly keen on the idea of entering the festival, but my concern would be that I‚Äôd either be assumed by the festival organisers/audience/media to be LGBTQ+ or that I‚Äôd be excluded from receiving awards, based on my sexuality. If my Co-Director were to win awards for OUR role in the film, and I wasn‚Äôt eligible, I feel like that‚Äôs somewhat discriminatory. Obviously this doesn‚Äôt sit well with me.\\n\\nSo AITA for opposing entering the festival? Should I support something that I can‚Äôt really be apart of?\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

He told me I was everything he wanted in a partner, which I found sweet but he froze up when I told him I loved how safe he was. He got unusually serious and asked me what I meant by that. I explained that in my teens and early twenties I had a habit of choosing guys who were fun and passionate but really unpredictable - like the bad-boy type or athletes, but now I was getting older I wanted someone who would be a good father, have a good steady job, and would get along with my family. He seemed to take this as an insult and asked \"exactly how many men have I been with\"? I told him it was none of his business and then he started throwing a list of questions like \"Do you even find me attractive\", \"How long have you felt this way\", etc. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThese questions were insulting and he was being a dick but after arguing about this for half an hour, I gave him the whole summary that he should not be jealous of my previous relationships, he had no right to pry into my past, that I do find him attractive for his qualities not necessarily his looks, and that he should be proud that he\\'s the first guy I was with that ever met my parents. This seemed to make him more upset and then he had the audacity to ask him if he was first \"Asian guy\" I\\'ve ever dated (we\\'re both Asian). I told him the truth, that yes he was, but that it meant nothing. He suddenly stormed out of the living and shouted that I\\'m using him as a safety net to please my family.

       " 'So my friend I have known since kindergarten ( I‚Äôm almost 40) married my wife‚Äôs sister. Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her ‚Äúmy Betsy‚Äù, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he‚Äôs basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It‚Äôs just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won‚Äôt talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that‚Äôs known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\\n\\nEdit: I really don‚Äôt feel like the Asshole. I just wanted to bounce this off a bunch of people to see if the creepy feels are justified.  \\n\\nEdit2: Clarifications and additional detail.  My wife is fully on board with him not seeing our daughter she just hates losing her sister. \\n\\nBIL and SIS in law  will have their first child in A few months. \\n\\nYes I think there are developing mental issues with BIL. Depression seems most likely but it‚Äôs no excuse for the strange behavior. \\n\\nHe also has been very standoffish to me and my wife lately. \\n\\nBIL also didn‚Äôt want to have a girl because he didn‚Äôt want it to take away from his love for my daughter. SIL actually told me this like it was so sweet and endearing. I feel sick writing this. \\n\\nOh ya. I was tactful and calm when talking to him.  I might have been pushy at first but it‚Äôs Hugh tension convo. I repeatedly ask why he did not see that it was wrong. He did not see anything wrong with his behavior. Annnnnnnd I recorded the conversation since it was such a serious discussion. No I will not share it for obvious reasons. \\n\\nEdit: thank you for the feedback. As a small\\nMajority have pointed out it might be harmless (albeit still creepy) and I have thought about that.  It sure does suck for everyone involved if that‚Äôs the case. The consequences of not addressing this and something actually bad happening , I could never forgive myself. \\n\\nFinal edit: Thank you again for the advice everyone. A lot of you shared your personal experiences with abuse to assure me I did the right thing and that in itself is not an easy thing to extend to a stranger. He‚Äôs a creep any way you look at it.

       " 'I met this girl on Tinder and we really hit it off. I asked her out on a date to a cozy restaurant in our small town (Gainesville, FL). \\n\\nI had to take the bus there (my moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. \\n\\nThe date was going ok. It was kind of awkward at first because we just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so I decided to break the tension. A while ago, I heard about a life pro-tip where  if you order French fries at a restaurant  without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. I\\'ve been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. \\n\\nWhen the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. I then asked the waitress, \"Does the Guac have onions?\" To which she responded, \"Yes, it does\".  I then proceeded to tell her, \"I have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?\" I told her I have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn\\'t just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, my date asked me, \"are you really allergic?\" To which I said \"no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac\". She was pretty impressed like \"damn, I\\'m stealing this one\". When the guac came in, I asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. \\n\\nThe rest of the date went well. We ordered some drinks first and then food later. What I forgot to do when I was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. When I got my dish, I took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. I didnt know how to react so I just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he\\'s asking if everything is ok so I tell him that I forgot to mention not to put onions and that I have a severe allergy. \\n\\nThe first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  \\n\\n(Side note: I don\\'t have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. I have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but I know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, I thought it makes you cough a lot, I don\\'t know why I thought that.) \\n\\nCutscene to now: I start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. I tell him, \"I barely got any onions in the bite\". My date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. I told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that I\\'m okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. I asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (Not like we ate anyway) but I still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. \\n\\nAfter leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. I shot my shot and asked her if she\\'d just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where I grab my bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. I\\'m sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that I am taking the bus to the emergency room.  \\n\\nHe kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. I finally gave up and told him , \"Okay\". In my head, I thought I\\'d just let him drop me there and then I\\'ll take an uber back home. However, we get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK.  I\\'m like hey man, trust me, IM OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to me. You can leave. It was so awkward. We were parked and he kept asking if I\\'m sure and I\\'m like yes I\\'m sure don\\'t worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. \\n\\nAt the end he said he\\'d just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. We walk in the emergency room and I\\'m the only person there. Great. I had to walk to the nurse and tell her that I might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and I\\'m like yes, everything is going to be okay. \"Thank you so much for everything.\" He gives me his number and tells me to inform him once I\\'m out. \\n\\nHere I am.

He says, \"Are you allergic to anything?\" And I go \"No\". \\n\\nHe gave me a benadryl and sent me out. I then spent another $25 to Uber home. I told what happened to my friend and she said I was the worst kind of asshole. I learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy, but I don\\'t think I was an asshole because I did try to avoid as much confrontation as possible, and even ensured the waitress and supervisor that it was all my fault.

I‚Äôm grateful it didn‚Äôt suffer too long but of course I‚Äôm hysterical. I managed to dispose of the bird and clean up the mess (which I would rather not discuss because it was somewhat traumatizing).\\n\\nI ended up calling my boyfriend to tell him the bird escaped out a window I didn‚Äôt know was open. \\n\\nNormally I would never lie about something like this. The problem is that my boyfriend already **hates** my cat and makes it clear he only deals with her because of me. (My cat won‚Äôt attack a person but won‚Äôt allow anyone but me to pick her up and handle her or she‚Äôll scratch. If you try to just pet her she may deal with it or she may run away, depending on her mood). Anyway, it‚Äôs been a struggle.\\n\\nI feel so bad but I know if I tell my boyfriend what happened he‚Äôs going to hate my cat even more and want to get rid of her.

I know that it‚Äôs wrong to be dishonest but I don‚Äôt want to have to choose between my boyfriend or my cat. It would break my heart and nothing is going to bring the bird back.

Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing.

I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. (My niece, who was our flower girl, and a few other kids who had to be at the wedding for one reason or another we‚Äôre getting picked up/dropped off after the ceremony ended). \\n\\nAnyway the reception rolls around (I‚Äôm fast forwarding through irrelevant details about the wedding but it was beautiful and everything went as smoothly as could be expected). The couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children.\\n\\nI had many other guests and didn‚Äôt really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking up the child as the reception (and wedding, frankly!) were not supposed to have children. \\n\\nI mean, everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and  a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan. (The infant  already had to be taken out once during the wedding ceremony because of fussiness and the toddler was, from what I could see, already appearing cranky). \\n\\nMy event planner went to talk to the couple. I could tell they were arguing with my event planner though so I went over to help him. I think they thought I came to rescue them because they started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the event was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. \\n\\nThe wife gave a sort of apology and then assured me that they were capable of minding their own children to make sure they didn‚Äôt get in the way of anything. I said that wasn‚Äôt really the point. That‚Äôs when my now-husband comes over and he and the other woman‚Äôs husband begin going back and forth and things got a little heated. \\n\\nFinally I snapped and said that they just needed to go, which, thankfully they did without much more noise. Still, the whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. \\n\\nI really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. \\n\\nWas I the a-hole for making them leave?\\n\\n**Edit 1: Wow um this kind of blew up out of nowhere. Thank you all so much for the feedback. What I‚Äôve gotten from this is that most people think that the couple was rude. There are also a select few who feel that it‚Äôs assholish to have a kid-free wedding at all which is...interesting.**\\n\\n**By way of an update, I have now learned that a few family members felt that it was inappropriate of me to kick out the couple.

This has been going on for many years and it really bothers my wife as we have been married for twelve years at this point and they are both fully aware of our names. \\n\\nAnyway, we recently got a Christmas card from my dad and it was addressed using only my last name as the family name.

He also said that now he would need to return a gift that he got us which was a customer tree ornament that had the family name on it (just mine and not hers or hyphenated). It turned into a bit of an argument and then what seemed like an annoyed apology.

She wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer.\\n\\nThe gift inside was a hideous purple Wal-Mart dress not in my size. The texture of the fabric immediately made me want to scrub my hands. I admit I could have reacted more enthusiastically. I just did not have the energy in me to fake it. \\n\\nMy mother was obviously upset at my less than ecstatic reaction. She got very flustered and told me I was free to return it but she did not have a receipt for the item and couldn‚Äôt I just try to like it?  Couldn‚Äôt I just try to appreciate her taste in gifts for once?\\n\\nThis sounds like making a mountain out of a molehill but this has been a pattern for a long, long time. Previous gifts have included; dollar store jewelry that causes me to break out in a rash (multiple years, multiple conversations on why she never saw me wear it), lipgloss that she had opened and liked, etc. Nearly every time she will take the gifts back for herself under the guise that at least someone (herself) will get use out of it.\\n\\nIt would be one thing if these things came from an acquaintance that did not know me that well. But my mother has known me for 29 years. She was there growing up as the cheap costume jewelry she insisted I wear kept causing infections in my ears, she was there when as a toddler I would scratch myself bloody over clothing textures, she has never in my entire life seen my voluntary wear makeup.\\n\\nI put a lot of thought into the gifts I give. I shop through the year, never leaving things to the last minute. I keep a list on my phone of things people in my life mention they like or would buy for themselves if they could justify the spending. \\n\\nI know I shouldn‚Äôt hold other people to the same standards I hold myself to.

Reddit, am I the asshole for hating the gifts my mother gives me?\\n\\nEDIT: Woah, you guys have given me a lot to think about. I do think having a sitdown with my mom (not during an emotionally fraught holiday) in in order.\\n\\nFor the record, I do not feel entitled to any gifts from anyone. During the lead up to Christmas and birthdays I do convey when prompted that I am \"too old\" for presents, that I don\\'t need more stuff, that I appreciate the thought but please do not buy me things. I tell family and friends I\\'m happy just to spend the special day with them. That if they feel to hand over a physical gift, I\\'m happy to take a card (I have a display of them going back 10 years)\\n\\nI should also note that, no, my mother is not extremely impoverished. She lives well. Not rich, but not hurting for money. \\n\\nThe rashes I get come from eczema. I should have said fabric rather than texture. \\n\\nI think after the holidays I\\'m going to sit down with her and tell her face to face that while I love the heart that goes into the spirit of gift giving, I\\'d rather she skipped a step and got something to pamper herself. \\n\\n\\n**EDIT TO THE EDIT**\\n\\nI took my mother out for brunch to apologize and reiterate that I do not need gifts, and that I especially do not need gifts that cause a painful rash. Finally got to the root of the problem:\\n\\n* According to her, I can\\'t possibly have an reaction to nickel plating or polyester because she touched it and was fine with it and therefore I do not have the genetic component to have that happen\\n\\n* The reason she keeps pushing jewelry (that reacts with my eczema), makeup (that reacts with my eczema), dresses (in fabrics that react with my eczema) on me is because if I don\\'t embrace my femininity I\\'m clearly going to turn into a big ol\\' lesbian. **That\\'s it.**  Mystery solved!

I will call the gay friend John for this posts sake.\\n\\nThe night started normal, John was spending a lot of time talking to one of the girls (who I had previously had a one night stand with, everybody knows it\\'s no big deal). Out of nowhere he comes and sits by me and starts asking really weird questions like \"Do you ever get horny at work?\", \"Jessica said you have a pretty cock, is it?\" (Jessica is not her name, and yes that is the actual question he asked me). I felt really uncomfortable and laughed it off and pretended I had to go the bathroom. He followed me there and used the urinal next to me, he was glancing downwards so I quickly finished and told one of my co workers how he is acting. Fast forward a few hours and we are all dancing, and it seems to have blown over until he walks past me and brushes his hand on the crotch area of my jeans. I get a little annoyed this time as I\\'m not here for this, i have a girlfriend and he knows I am not gay. I pull him aside and tell him he needs to stop Because it\\'s making me pissed and uncomfortable, he agrees and says it was just a joke.\\n\\nWe go into another club and he does it again, this time actuslly grabbing the crotch area and squeezing, it was crowded and dark so it was hard to see for the others. I flipped and pushed him away from me pretty hard, he fell over and hurt his elbow and ankle and apparently his ankle is in a cast.\\n\\nI explained why i done this and one of the other female workers confirmed she had   him in the previous club brushing his hand on me. Now our group w,ork WhatsApp is pretty awkward and people have been asking him in the group if he\\'s okay and shit, i feel like they\\'re having digs at me. AITA?',\n",
       " 'I‚Äôve been in a friends with benefits relationship with John for the past five years. During this time it has been on and off, and our arrangement would always stop when either of us were dating other people or in a serious relationship. The rules were that we were always honest with each other if we were seeing someone else, and we would immediately halt if this were the case. \\n\\nTo give some context, I have known John since I was a kid, as we are close family friends. However, when this agreement began John was adamant that we must keep it a secret as it could be problematic if our families found out. \\n\\nAfter I returned from overseas in April this year, we resumed our FWB ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô. In June, I became suspicious that John was seeing someone else after a mutual friend made a comment about seeing him out with another girl. I asked him about this, and he said that he had a girlfriend while I was overseas but he had broken up with her before we resumed. I found it a little strange that he did not tell me this, but since we had always been honest with each other in the past I brushed this off (big mistake). \\n\\nA few weeks ago John messaged me and asked me to come over. As I was at work, I told him that I would message him that night. When I finished my shift, I invited him over to my house. He responded and said that he couldn‚Äôt, as he was at Bonnie‚Äôs house. When I asked who Bonnie was, he said that she was his girlfriend, and that he thought I knew that. I freaked out and immediately blocked him on Facebook messenger. I now know that this was some kind of weird power play, but I am ultimately still confused as to why he decided to tell me this way.\\nAfter he realised that I had blocked him, he texted my phone and asked if I was okay. He apologised, and said that he had ‚Äúsome things to work out‚Äù. I asked him how long he had been dating her, and he reluctantly told me that he had been with her since February. Keep in mind that I had also seen his family since then, and no one had ever mentioned that he had a girlfriend, nor did I see any posts on social media of John and Bonnie. I was unaware that this girl existed until this moment.\\n\\nI felt absolutely disgusting and messaged some of my friends to tell them what had happened. Each of them all said the same thing- that I should tell Bonnie. I was hesitant to do this as I did not want to ruin this poor girl‚Äôs life. I slept on it and in the morning I found her on facebook (through mutual friends and thankfully Bonnie isn‚Äôt that common of a name where I‚Äôm from). I sent her a message request explaining the whole situation, and telling her that I had screenshots if she wanted to see them. She was shocked and told me that her and John were actually planning to celebrate their one year anniversary soon (more surprises) and that he had lied to me about when they started dating (not that it even mattered at this point). \\nShe asked for the screenshots and told me that she would break up with him the next day. Despite the horrible situation, she was thankful for me for telling her.\\n\\nA week later I received a message from John‚Äôs best friend, Kane, telling me that what I had done was absolutely disgusting. Although he was angry at John, he said that I was in the wrong for breaking up their relationship. He explained that Bonnie was suicidal and that I had caused her serious harm. He also said that John‚Äôs mother (who is my mother‚Äôs best friend) did not believe that I didn‚Äôt know John had a girlfriend. Kane also said that all the mutual friends he has spoken to think the same thing. Obviously this is untrue, as this whole thing wouldn‚Äôt have happened if I knew he had a girlfriend. I had to tell my mother what had happened before she heard it from John‚Äôs mother, and now this has caused a rift between the two of them.\\n\\nI honestly thought that I would want to know if I was being cheated on and that telling Bonnie was the right thing to do. I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy at all, but I know that I have told the 100% truth in this situation and I have the evidence to prove it. I don‚Äôt doubt that John has told a different version of this story to his friends, however I still feel like absolute trash, despite this being entirely his fault. \\n\\nAm I the asshole for telling her?

       " 'Normally my MIL visits us every spring. She works at a school so she spends spring break with us. She is a kind and sweet woman, but she lets her daughter push her around and is not very bright. I have to keep a close eye on her to make sure she‚Äôs not creating dangerous situations for my small children. I like her, but it‚Äôs difficult to have her here. \\n\\nLast summer she planned to come out in July (without asking us first) instead of March with my SIL and her husband as well . Turns out this was all the sisters idea. My SIL has never visited us, never met either of my children. Overall is just a terrible person. I can‚Äôt stand her because of the way she treats my husband. \\n\\nSo basically it went like this: \\nSIL: We‚Äôre coming out for this week in July. \\n\\nMe: That‚Äôs not a good time for us, Husband can‚Äôt take time off work that week. I have plans. Let‚Äôs look at a different week. \\n\\nSIL: No that‚Äôs all we can do. So we will be there. End of discussion. \\n\\nSo I changed all my plans. We set up the beds. Had everything ready for a visit that we didn‚Äôt want to host. Then they don‚Äôt show up and check in on fb getting on a cruise ship. I have to say I was pretty relieved that I didn‚Äôt have to spend a week with my SIL and try to hide the fact that I‚Äôd like to kill her. My husband on the other hand was devastated. No one called him or let him know. We had to tell the kids memaw wasn‚Äôt coming to visit after all. It was a disaster. \\n\\nSo now, my MIL wants to just pretend nothing ever happened and come visit us in March this year. I told my husband no. I said I don‚Äôt want her here until she acknowledges how badly she and her daughter hurt his feelings and the feelings of my kids. They were completely out of line and I will not ignore that! \\n\\nAITA for not allowing this to be swept under the rug? \\n',\n",
       " 'This happened years ago on a Ryanair flight and is obviously not a big deal, but to this day I wonder if how I acted was okay or assholish.\\n\\nSo I was sitting in my seat during the flight and got up to pee and change my pad (as - TMI - I was on a heavy day of my period and worried about leakage). I wait in line in front of the lavatory, 2 or 3 people in front of me already waiting as well. After 5-10 minutes it\\'s finally my turn and I move to enter. \\n\\nJust then a little kid (4-5 years, maybe?) comes running down the aisle, his dad walking a few feet behind him, and kiddo tries to squeeze past my legs into the lavatory as I\\'m opening the door. I hold my arm out in front of the child and say kindly but firmly \"No, you have to wait in line like I did, it\\'s not your turn.\" Dad says nothing and I move into the stall and close the door. I felt like I was in the right because I had waited in line, I really had to change my pad soon or there\\'d be blood on my pants, and I thought I was being fair and polite letting the kid know why he had to wait.\\n\\nSomeone gives a few firm knocks on the door but I just say \"occupied!\" and quickly do my business. As I exit the restroom the dad and child are gone, presumably to use the lavatory in the back of the plane. A male flight attendant, however, is waiting next to the door and in a tone like he has to school an idiot says \"What you did was very rude, that was just a child, what if that was an emergency?\" In an admittedly snippy tone I replied \"What if it was an emergency for me too?\" and went back to my seat.\\n\\nDoes not letting a child go first automatically make me the asshole, like that flight attendant thought? I would\\'ve let kid and dad cut in line if they\\'d asked, and feel bad because obviously a child can\\'t hold it in like an adult can, but because of the whole trying to squeeze past me approach, my gut reaction was \"no way\".',\n",
       " ' I was in Target the day after Christmas. I live in a large city so it was packed with people returning stuff and the usual shopping. I needed to use the restroom so I went to do that.   \\n\\n  \\n  There was quite a line of people so I decided to act civilized and get in line. The man behind me had a kid (probably like 6 or 7) with him and was getting really upset really fast. While there was about 2 people a head of me a store associate came out and told us he needed a minute to clean the bathroom. Obviously none of use were happy but what are you going to do? The associate goes in the bathroom to clean it up. \\n\\n  \\n  Almost immediately the guy behind me starts complaining very loudly how the worker was probably in there doing nothing and making us wait on purpose. To be fair the associate did take about 10 minutes but the guy was talking loud enough that I think the associate in the bathroom could have heard it fairly clearly. I worked retail so I know how stressed the holidays are on people so I texted my girlfriend telling her it would be a while. I also texted her, \"There is a guy behind me who is acting like a baby about having to wait. He is throwing a little tantrum that is kinda funny.\"     \\n \\n\\n I get out of the text app and start browsing Reddit or something. The guy behind me starts really calling the associate names and generally being an asshole to the young guy who is just doing his job. I turn around and give him a look and he says to me, \"You shut up. I saw what you said about me, asshole.\"   \\n \\n\\n So at this point I\\'m a little stunned because there must have been an effort to look over my shoulder and see what I was texting. That\\'s kinda a huge violation of privacy in my opinion. I get a little pissed fast and turn to his kid and said, \"Santa Claus is not real. It\\'s your parents. Also the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are not real. It\\'s all your parents work.\" I walked away at that point because I didn\\'t want a physical altercation to happen or anything.   \\n\\n\\n  Am I the asshole? Maybe what I didn\\'t wasn\\'t proportional but I think it was if you have ever worked retail on the holidays and if I was the associate I would be cheering for me.  \\n\\n\\ntl;dr: Stranger acts like an asshole to retail associate, reads my private text over my shoulder, calls me an asshole for texting that he was being a baby, I tell his kid that Santa isn\\'t real. \\n\\nEdit 1: Thanks for all the feedback! It seems split 50/50 for the most part. Keep the comments coming!\\n\\nEdit 2: Didn\\'t realize that so many tough guys were on Reddit. Noice messages! ',\n",

Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn\\'t continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \\n\\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother\\'s house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend\\'s mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \\n\\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn\\'t see her cutting either of the ones I\\'d bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend\\'s mom was just cutting her\\'s last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn\\'t cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that\\'s not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she\\'d done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I\\'m just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she\\'d done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it\\'s Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it\\'d put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don\\'t know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn\\'t believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she\\'d been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I\\'d brought. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend\\'s mom why it wasn\\'t one of the things I\\'d brought along and she just shushed her and said it\\'s okay.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow I know this isn\\'t catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn\\'t approve of me.

Wife hasn‚Äôt been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and I actually just got a new job. \\n\\nAt my old job I was working 45-50 hours a week. At my new job my hours fluctuate a lot ‚Äî it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. I make a lot more though so there‚Äôs that.

I recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce I would support her 100%. But I think it‚Äôs fair that if I‚Äôm the sole paycheck and working crazy hours I don‚Äôt come home to more stress and chaos. \\n\\nObviously my wife and I will have to work this out between ourselves. I‚Äôm mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base. \\n\\n**Edit: Well this blew up since I last checked it. I can see people are really passionate about this topic and you all have encouraged me to think more deeply about it. I will read as many of the (4.2K??) comments as I can. I think I‚Äôll let my wife take a look at the thread too since many have gone out of their way to offer constructive comments for both of us.**',\n",
       " 'So, last night to celebrate new years me and my wife decided to go to a fairly fancy restaurant nearby. The place was packed and you needed to make reservations to just get in. When we got in we were seated and things were going well, until another family was sat next to us. It was a mother, father, and 3 children. Immediately we both knew there was going to be an issue. While the restaurant was busy and a little noisy it was nowhere near the level the three children were at. \\n\\nOne of the children was obviously special needs and was having outburst every few minutes while the other two were making quite a bit of noise. At first I decided to put up with it, but eventually I lost my cool when the special needs child started to scream and threw crayons they brought with them around (one of them landed on our table). \\n\\nI got up and asked (I though I asked kindly, but my wife says I came off a bit harsh) for them to get control of their children and to conciser the people around them. They apologized for everything and began trying to get everything under control. \\n\\nThis is where the second problem comes in, to keep their children entertained they pulled out a tablet and began playing videos on it, at full volume with no headphones. I got up again and told them to \"turn the damn thing off\" or get them headphones. I could tell they were both embarrassed and they apologized again but said that they could not get headphones due to their special needs son (they specifically called him this so I know I was not just guessing) being uncomfortable with it but said they wouldn\\'t be able to turn it off.\\n\\nAt this point I stormed off to get the manager. When I got there I demanded a new table away from the other family. The restaurant was packed so this wasn\\'t an option so the manager brought me with him and asked the other family to leave. The mother looked like she was about to cry and the father grabbed his kids and stormed off. \\n\\nMy wife would not talk to me the rest of the night and at home told me that I was wrong for how I acted. Honestly though I don\\'t feel bad at all. The restaurant is pretty expensive and we only go there once or twice a year so I believe that I was within my right to want to enjoy a meal I play for without hearing kids screaming or a tabled blaring. Am I wrong?',\n",
       " \"My husband and I just got into (another) fight because his best friend who comes over every Wednesday is (again) staying the night. \\n\\nMy husband and this friend have had a Wednesday night ‚Äúdate‚Äù where the guy comes over to our house to ‚Äújam‚Äù every week for the last two years, and I‚Äôm getting to the point that I want to hit the guy over the head with whatever is closest at hand every time he is around. \\n\\nBuckle up. This is probably going to be a long one.... if you make it through all of this you are my hero. \\n\\nAt first he was supposed to come over just for a few hours on Wednesday nights to play guitar with my husband while I was at work. Over time I have stopped working late Wednesday‚Äôs but the jam session continues. Which was fine. However, for the last year they have barely touched the guitars and instead the guy just comes over to get high (on pot). Neither my husband or I get high with him (I don‚Äôt enjoy pot and my husband isn‚Äôt much into it either, but we aren‚Äôt morally against it so we didn‚Äôt say anything early on when we should have). \\n\\nNow that he is always high here, he NEVER leaves at the end of the night. Just expects to sleep over. But he doesn‚Äôt have a regular sleep schedule so instead of sleeping while we are, he is wandering around our house all night (in his boxers) making noises, watching tv, getting nonstop text alerts from other friends and ect. This always wakes me up and I have to pass by him on the way to the bathroom. At these points he always has demands. Like: ‚ÄúI want to watch this random movie your husband said you had. Find it for me.‚Äù Or ‚Äúyou need to change your litter box right now, because your cat just pooped and I can‚Äôt stand the smell.‚Äù He always says he‚Äôll leave when my husband goes for work at 8am, but then complains that he couldn‚Äôt sleep until 6am, so he ends up sleeping until mid day. At which point he just decides to stay until my husband gets home from work and then the whole thing starts over again. What‚Äôs supposed to be one night a week often turns into at least two every week. \\n\\nOn top of never leaving, he has started showing up HOURS before my husband gets off work on Wednesday‚Äôs. My husband has told him ‚Äúmy home is your home‚Äù so he just comes right in. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if he could self entertain. But no. He comes in and will just walk into our bedroom (where I‚Äôm hiding) sit down on the bed, take a hit of his shit, and start talking to me through whatever I‚Äôm doing/watching on tv. \\n\\nEvery time he is here he eats A LOT of our food (gets the munchies, plus regular meals) but never once has had the courtesy to bring anything of his own, or to share, or to replace what he is eating here. He just goes into our fridge and pantry and eats whatever he wants because my husband told him our home was his. \\n\\nMy husband is always begging me to be nice and not say anything while he is here because he is lonely and needs friends.... except he has his other best friend living with him, and is constantly going on weekend trips all over the country to visit his other friends.  Not to mention those nonstop text message alerts all night. \\n\\nDealing with this guy is like hanging out with a 17 year old stoner non stop. He farts and burps as loud as possible wherever. Whenever. Is demanding and needy, but completely rude at the same time. Saying things like ‚Äúdude! You actually made your house look SORTA nice this week.‚Äù (As I was prepping for Christmas), and ‚Äúso you do sometimes make an effort on your looks‚Äù (when I had gone somewhere nice and come home with makeup on). He also complains non stop about the food I make (yet eats it all anyway). \\n\\nThis year for my birthday we couldn‚Äôt afford to get any gifts, so I asked my husband instead to line up his days off so we could spend four days just us together...... then this guy broke up with his girlfriend and my husband begged me to let him come over just for a bit on the first evening. Que TWO full weeks of him not going home, and demanding all of my husband‚Äôs time. I spent ‚Äúour time‚Äù and my birthday, holed up in our room alone. \\n\\nThen, Christmas comes. I had invited my whole family to our house and tried to make things extra special because it was the first time I got to see my parents on Christmas in more than ten years. This guy‚Äôs mom had just moved to another state BUT this guy has plenty of money and no job to work around so he could have easily made the trip to her for Christmas. But he didn‚Äôt. Then his other friend/housemate also went out of town and he threw a ‚Äúwoe is me, I‚Äôm all alone one Christmas Eve, no one loves me‚Äù tantrum until my husband invited him to our house. He shows up. Gets high. And is a complete ass to everyone. Then throws a fit when he decides to sleep over because he has to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag (my family were in the other beds.) the next morning we sit down to breakfast and he lets out this HUGE stinky fart right at the table like it‚Äôs nothing, then proceeds to dish himself up 90% of the food and just generally be a douche. My family was flat out disgusted by him and his behavior and couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. He stayed for three days. \\n\\nI feel like an ass hole because he is my husband‚Äôs best friend and I don‚Äôt want to make them not hang out, and honestly he hasn‚Äôt done anything truly terrible. He‚Äôs just annoying as shit. I fucking dread every Wednesday, and then I‚Äôm super irritated the whole time he‚Äôs here. Which I hide from him, at my husband‚Äôs request, but then my husband and I always end up fighting over him not leaving at the end of the night. \\n\\nI‚Äôm honestly one or two Wednesday‚Äôs away from homicide with this guy, and all this I‚Äôve told you is just the tip of the iceberg. \\n\\nIf you‚Äôve made it this far, please tell me AITA for being upset at my husband for letting this guy stay over again tonight, and wanting a substantial break from his best friend? \\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR My husband‚Äôs best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you all for your overwhelming response!! I haven‚Äôt been able to reply to all of you, but I want you to know I‚Äôve read every post and I appreciate all of your opinions (even the ones calling me a shrew) and your great advice! \\n\\nSome clarification and an update: In case you weren't already sick of reading all this >< \\n\\n\\nClarification 1: As some have pointed out, there isn‚Äôt much of an action here for me to ask AITA about. I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt make it clearer originally. The question is am I unreasonable and being an Ass Hole for wanting a break from having this friend over. My husband and I fought over this last night and he feels I‚Äôm being overly upset and needlessly irritable at said friend. You‚Äôve already read how I feel about it. \\n\\n\\nClarification 2: This post, admittedly doesn't give much positive about the friend. His friend has been in my husband‚Äôs life since he was in grade school, and while the friend is over they do actively chat, watch movies, and generally hang out while I actively hide and feel irritated. All this stuff for sure could look like an exaggeration if it all happened in the last few days, but this is sorta my laundry list of the last two years of grievances which have been building up over time. On a regular Wednesday he is just stoned, flatulent, and childish, which while annoying, isn‚Äôt really actively douchy. He has done some very nice things for my husband, such as paying to take him to some very expensive concerts so that they could both nerd out over their favorite guitar players Live. I -clearly- don‚Äôt like the guy, but my husband gets a lot of enjoyment out of their friendship and I‚Äôm not saying that has to stop. Just that -I- need a break. Also, my husband DOES have other friends, they just have lives so he only gets to hang out once every few months with them. He is also in a band with other friends whom he sees regularly every Monday night. \\n\\nClarification 3: My husband doesn‚Äôt see a problem with how he speaks to me because according to him ‚Äúthe guy just has poor social skills, that comment about your makeup was a compliment.‚Äù\\n\\nClarification 4: He smokes a vape style pot pen, not a physical bud, which has less residual scent and is why my husband told him he could do it in the house. Before he started using I was ok with him. He still had poor manners, but he wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as he is now, and he never spent the night (or longer). Back before the pot I even enjoyed hanging out with the two of them every so often. Oh and I KNOW my husband occasionally also imbibes with him, which isn‚Äôt something that makes me mad. He doesn‚Äôt go overboard like his friend. \\n\\nUPDATE: When I woke up this morning I noticed that my phone was buzzing‚Ä¶. And buzzing‚Ä¶. And buzzing‚Ä¶. As all these awesome comments kept pouring in. I have never really had much success on Reddit, so when I looked and saw how many comments there were I said ‚ÄúOh My GoD!‚Äù Of course my husband asked what was wrong and I said ‚ÄúI told the internet the story of ***** and asked if I was the ass hole for what we fought over last night.‚Äù He said..‚ÄùOh‚Äù and that was it. BUT then on his way out of the bedroom he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get him up‚Äù, and by the time I was dressed and out of the room they guy was out of the house and driving away. Hallelujah!!! \\n\\nForty minutes later when he got to work I received a text message telling me how I was his best friend and that he loves me more than the world ect. Then we texted back and forth and he said ‚ÄúI really feel like we both contribute to it. I feel like you are overly grumpy on things pertaining to *****. But at the same time, I invite him to come up extra days, or stay the night without running it by you. I feel we could both do better and relieve a lot of stress and frustration. Do you agree?‚Äù  \\n\\nHe then called a few minutes later and I told him that I know I‚Äôm grumpy but I feel like it‚Äôs reasonably so. I also told him I didn‚Äôt want to force them not to be friends just that -I- needed a break from the friend. Then I gave him some possible solutions such as hanging out at his house every other week, or have a set time that the guy needs to stop smoking in order to drive home later (thanks guys! Great suggestions!) and he agreed to consider other arrangements with the hang out time so that I could have some time away from the friend, and we agreed to talk more about it when he is off work tonight. Although I can tell he STILL isn‚Äôt seeing a problem other than my attitude : / \\n\\nAgain thank you to everyone who has commented! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR My husband‚Äôs best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time? \\n\",\n",
       " 'Update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)\\n\\n   I\\'ve been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. You can skip to the TL;DR if the exposition is too long.\\n\\nShe\\'s a self-proclaimed \"foodie\", which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she\\'s a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. \\n\\nIf you taste something and wonder, \\'what\\'s that super subtle flavor?\\' she\\'ll tell you, \\'it\\'s anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.\\' When someone is cooking something and they go, \\'it\\'s missing something,\\' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.\\n\\n(It doesn\\'t stop there, she knew I had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as I walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. It\\'s either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)\\n\\nThat\\'s not it, either. She *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, BAM, I\\'m eating my grandmother\\'s homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. \\n\\nIt\\'s gotten to the point where I don\\'t see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. Even the most exotic ingredients aren\\'t out of her reach, either, and, even though it\\'s not about cost, I\\'ve saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can\\'t figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it\\'s just a matter of time - and sushi.\\n\\nOur anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, \"I\\'m not learning how to make sushi because then I\\'ll *never* get a real date ever again.\" We ended up going out instead.\\n\\nIt kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. She\\'s *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like Olive Garden \"because she likes the red sauce\" or other places because she likes the food, and now that I\\'m thinking about it, she\\'s gotten kinda gloomy because I\\'ve asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.\\n\\nShe also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she\\'s tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it\\'s served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste I\\'ve ever seen so I kinda think it\\'s just an excuse.\\n\\nI just don\\'t think it\\'s worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that\\'s just as excellent.\\n\\nTL;DR: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because I practically have a private chef of my very own?\\n\\nEdit: it\\'s not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, I just thought that it was worth mentioning because it\\'s been more of a saving than expected.\\n\\nEdit 2: I\\'m taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. I\\'m also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of Twitter, please don\\'t smother me in my sleep for being such a dick\\n\\nEdit3: no, twitter, I don\\'t buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. I buy her herbs and succulents. What flowers do I buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?\\n\\nAlso, yes, I wash the dishes\\n\\n#Final Edit:\\n\\nOkay guys. This will probably be my last edit. This post exploded unexpectedly and I\\'ve tried to respond to as many comments as I can, but there\\'s just too many of you. If you\\'ve asked me a direct question and I haven\\'t answered, I\\'m sorry. My inbox is a mess.\\n\\nI really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and I can honestly say that I\\'ve been an ass, and it\\'s really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. It\\'s honestly a surprise that she\\'s still my girlfriend after everything.\\n\\nSo her mom picked up the girls and I took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. She was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and I apologized for being stupid. After, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so I asked her to marry me.\\n\\nShe said no. She did it kindly, but she still said no. She said that it wasn\\'t a no forever, but she didn\\'t want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn\\'t think that it\\'s fair that our relationship happens on \\'my schedule\\' or \\'my terms\\'. \\n\\nI\\'m pretty heartbroken. I thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.\\n\\nSo, Reddit, you were all right. I\\'m the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn\\'t over restaurants.\\n\\n',\n",

I don't mind living on a smaller income because that's what I've always done until now. GF has about 2k/month of after-tax income. The problem is we disagree on what price range of rentals we should be looking at and how to split the rent.\\n\\nI was interested in an arrangement where we rent a 2-bedroom with my old roommate for around 1800/month combined (GF and I would share a room and our roommate would pay for her room) so that GF and I would pay 900/each.

She looked something up which was a studio at 2500/month and told me we should pay $2100/$400 to reflect our income disparity.

I‚Äôm like whatever and didn‚Äôt think it was a huge deal. \\n\\nWell as the night went on my gf started acting REALLY weird, like she was simultaneously quiet and really snappy at me. It got to the point where she was acting like she‚Äôs going to cry, putting her hands over her eyes, so I brought her outside and we just sat on a curb for a bit. Honestly I had thought something really bad had happened to her, like someone had groped her or something. \\n\\nSo she‚Äôs huffing and puffing and acting distressed and I‚Äôm begging her to tell me what‚Äôs wrong. She asks me not to judge her and I said of course, and she says that she feels horrible because that guy from like an hour ago had hit on HER and not the girl she was with. I was like..and that‚Äôs bad why? And then the floodgates opened.\\n\\nShe was cursing and crying basically, calling that guy all sorts of names but all it boiled down to was the fact that he was quite unattractive apparently and very short/overweight even tho he seemed like just some normal dude to me. Honestly I was a bit taken aback. I told her he probably just thought she was pretty and wanted to talk to her, but my gf was convinced it‚Äôs because he thought she‚Äôs more in his ‚Äúleague‚Äù than the girl that was with her. So I‚Äôm trying to comfort her while losing my patience now but I really lost it when she started calling him ‚ÄúApu‚Äù (like from the Simpsons, he looked Indian but not sure if he was). I was like ok nope nope nope it‚Äôs too late to deal with this crap anymore and I got up and basically just hailed a cab home. \\n\\nThe next morning my phone blew up from my gf because she couldn‚Äôt believe I left without telling her and stranding her at the club. She said she had to get a ride off of a friend and cried the whole time. I told her that I‚Äôve been very supportive of all her self esteem issues but I have a limit too. After another day she calls me EXTREMELY apologetic saying that she was just upset in the moment but she doesn‚Äôt want to break up over this. \\n\\nWe‚Äôve been in limbo since this and everyone is telling me that I‚Äôm overreacting. I don‚Äôt know. The stuff she was saying when she was upset was EXTREMELY vile. From the racist comment to everything else. My sympathy just plunged to the ground. But now everyone is telling me I fucked up and that I owe it to her to hear her out and that everyone makes mistakes when they‚Äôre at their most vulnerable. I‚Äôm really second guessing what I did and I do feel guilty for just leaving without telling her. \\n\\nSo, AITA?',\n",
       " 'Some background: \\n\\nWe are both 32. And we are both physicians. I work a lot (currently 55-60 hours a week on average) and am an attending physician. My wife is still finishing her fellowship training. But her fellowship is outpatient based and her hours are great. Maybe 30 hours a week she is in clinic. \\n\\n\\nNow we are currently expecting our first child and naturally we‚Äôre very excited. I want to support my wife as much as possible...but ever since we found out we were expecting, she has suddenly become very different. She lost interest in work, we had recent fights about her wanting to quit medicine and stop working entirely to focus on caring for the kid. She no longer helps out around the home. I have to do all the laundry, cooking, dishwashing, trash, bathroom cleaning because she says she is tired all the time. It‚Äôs not that she is physically confining herself at home because she is feeling fatigued, she is often still out and about either hanging out with her co-fellows and girlfriends or sits at home watching TV. \\n\\nFinally...I blew up at her yesterday when she didn‚Äôt go out to pick up some groceries when I asked her to prior to leaving for work. I yelled at her that being pregnant does not automatically make you disabled and unable to do anything. Maybe I was also still upset she had blown $1200 on a ridiculous Uppababy stroller without checking with me first last week (for context, I make at least $550k a year at my current working hours, she makes about 60k as a fellow) because I feel like I‚Äôm the one shouldering 90% of that expense. In any case, she got pissed off gave me the silent treatment since yesterday, am I the complete dick here for saying that or what?',\n",
       " 'EDIT: Okay I had to log out for a bit since I didn‚Äôt see my thoughts enormous assholiness and was not ready for that response. I think I was just in too of a dark place to see how bad this post is and even if I got a lot of nonconstructive comments that hurt I got a lot of comments that really hit it on the nail with how bad it would be to follow through with this as well as giving me really sound advice. I am going to see a therapist because yea something‚Äôs wrong with my head and I need to figure it out. I will also try to join single parent groups like a couple of you suggested which I really think will help. I talked to my ex-girlfriend as well and just tried to sense how she was feeling towards meeting my son (didn‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on her) and I‚Äôm pretty sure that she hasn‚Äôt changed her mind and that‚Äôs fine. I can‚Äôt ask my mom to move out her because of my actions, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair, she loves where she lives but she probably would move here for me nonetheless and I don‚Äôt want that for her. She lives in a rural area so I can‚Äôt move to her either with my job, but I am going to invest in a babysitter. Lastly I just want to say that I love my son and that i genuinely thought that him getting adopted by a stable family would be better for him when I wrote this yesterday but can now see how that can mess him up in so many different ways. I think I might have some sort of PPD that comes and goes and when I wrote this post I think I was at my lowest.\\n\\nThank you to everyone that took their time out to give me a thoughtful answer and to the people that reached out to me in private, I am really grateful.\\n\\nTLDR at the bottom\\n\\nSo on the spring of 2016 I found out that my college girlfriend got pregnant. She wanted to have an abortion but as a christian I felt that this was against my beliefs (btw I‚Äôm not pro-life, I feel like the option to abort should be there for people that don‚Äôt believe what I do but this is what I thought was right for my child). I was graduating that year and already had a pretty well-paying job lined up so I felt that I could provide for my kid. In the end me and my girlfriend came to the agreement that the baby be born but that I would be a single parent since she did not want to have a baby this young. That fall the baby was born and after that she moved back to her home state (she went out of state for college) and I got my son. At the time me and my girlfriend were 21.\\n\\nFast forward two years and I just feel so tired and secluded from the world. My only friend is my son, between work and him I have no free time. All I do on my free time is go to the park with him, watch kids shows etc. My mom live kinda far away but she visits every few months and lets me have some alone time but it‚Äôs not enough. Also I basically have the same job I had when I graduated college with a slight salary increase, I have not been able to take any initiatives at work to qualify me for a promotion due to my parent responsibilities and a lot of people that started after me outrank me now. And I can‚Äôt date, like who wants a 23 year old guy with a kid.\\n\\nI just feel unfulfilled and alone and it has started to take it‚Äôs form in a little bit of animosity against my son and I never want that to happen. I want to be a great dad that loves his kid but I don‚Äôt think I can be that, I‚Äôve tried for two years. You always hear about this undying love you‚Äôll have for your kid but I just never had that.\\n\\nSo WIBTA for putting my son up for adoption? I would have to make sure he actually get‚Äôs adopted into a stable family like I grew up in and not into a foster home  (don‚Äôt know how I would go about that though). The thing that makes me think that I am an asshole is that he has started to form an attachment to me and that it would be unfair on him to leave him and unfair on his grandmother that also has a good connection with him. But what makes me think I‚Äôm not an asshole is that I think that his childhood would just get worse the more lonely and unfulfilled I feel and that he‚Äôs better off with a more stable family. Please give me your perspective.\\n\\nTLDR: I am a single dad that feels like he‚Äôs personal life is interfering with his ability to be a father, WIBTA to put up my two year old for adoption? \\n\\nEDIT: Throwaway acc for obvious reasons\\n\\nEDIT: I feel like people are answering the question AITA for having a kid and then regretting my choice which I believe the entire world would agree that ITA, but I‚Äôm asking if in my current situation, as the asshole I am, WIBTA to put up my son for adoption now?',\n",
       " 'This happened yesterday and I tried  not to think much about it, but I just got another message demanding I apologize to my niece so I‚Äôm all worked up again.\\n\\n\\nYesterday I took my family (4 children + the wife and I) and my cousin‚Äôs family (my cousin + her husband and their daughter) out for lunch.  She‚Äôs a twice or thrice removed cousin and moved to our town five years ago, so we see each other often enough.  For reference, I refer to their daughter as my niece and she‚Äôs 12.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe place we went to is our favorite family restaurant, mom & pops kind of place. We go at least twice a month, great food, fantastic  service and we know each staff member by name. They‚Äôre very attentive and one of the big reasons we keep going back is because of how nice they all are.\\n\\n\\nSo everything is great, we have a pleasant conversation, a few laughs, finish eating and I ask for the bill. I paid and left $120 tip inside the bill folder. We start leaving and my niece tells us to go ahead because she‚Äôs gotta use the toilet before leaving, so I‚Äôm the last one to talk out the door when I notice her sneaking back to our table and stealing the tip I left for our waitress. I bolted and walked over to her, grabbed her by the arm and half dragged her to the front of house, where I asked the manager to call our waitress over . It all happened so fast she didn‚Äôt even have time to react or say anything. Our waitress came over and I told her my niece had stolen the tip I‚Äôd left for her and wanted to return it and apologize.  So my niece said it was an accident and she didn‚Äôt mean to steal it, reached to her pocket and pulled out all the money. Then my cousin walks back in to see what we‚Äôre doing and see‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on. I tell her what happened and her daughter starts crying saying I‚Äôm humiliating her in front of everybody and my cousin starts yelling to me who am I to lecture her daughter.  I apologize to the manager and waitress and while we‚Äôre walking out my niece keeps crying saying she didn‚Äôt steal anything but she‚Äôd just gotten all the cash out her pocket and given it back to the waitress! \\n\\n\\nShe wanted me to apologize for what happened but I flat out refused because I didn‚Äôt think I was in the wrong. I only apologized for having grabbed her by the arm, which I have children, I know not to hurt a kid, I only grabbed her because it was a knee jerk reaction and hadn‚Äôt I grabbed her she would have run outside.  \\n\\n\\nJust for background information, my niece has a history of stealing tips. It‚Äôs happened a bunch of times that I‚Äòve gone out with her father for a coffee and we bring our kids so they can play, and a bunch of times she‚Äôs stolen the tips I left. She has 2 mo‚Äôs that  I‚Äôve noticed, one is stealing it after we leave the establishment and another is when I leave a tip on the bill tray on the table and I‚Äôm talking with her dad then I look again at the bill trey and the tip is gone. When I told her parents they both laughed it off saying she‚Äôs just mischievous. I called her out once and she replied with a smirk on her face saying I can‚Äôt prove she stole it because she had  put the tip money in her wallet with her own money so there was no way to know. \\n\\n\\nI understand she‚Äôs not my daughter and I‚Äôve no right to lecture her but obviously her parents don‚Äôt care much about her stealing tips. I mean her mom brags about stealing cheap jewelry at Claire‚Äôs, which is already fucking petty, it‚Äôs Claire‚Äôs, not Tiffany‚Äôs.  You raise your daughter as you wish, but not when it‚Äôs *my* money that *I* choose to give to our waitress for treating us so well.  \\n\\n\\nAll in all, we had an argument in the parking lot and things are looking ugly. They have resorted to calling me names instead of us talking this out like adults. If they want to call me names I‚Äôm gonna ignore the phone, so now they‚Äôre texting my wife telling her to tell me to apologize or they don‚Äôt wanna know nothing about us anymore. We don‚Äôt have much family and two of my kids love playing with their daughter, I don‚Äôt want them to lose a friend because I‚Äôm too stubborn to apologize but  I think is a matter of principle, I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong (besides grabbing her by the arm, which I know I didn‚Äôt hurt her).\\n',\n",

They live one thousand miles away, so this acts as a vacation that requires a significant amount of commitment. I am retired at 61 years old and make a decent living being retired, I own a home and relatively new luxury car. I have well amount of money saved and am proud of my financial savings. I have two daughters, she is my oldest, my other is currently going through school.\\n\\nMy other daughter does not talk to me because I did not pay for her schooling, not a dime, though I did pay off a car in full. I offered to loan her whatever she needed at one percent and she was very angry that I, her father would do such a thing and then blamed me for her not being able to get federal assistance. I do not believe in giving your children money when they become older, we do not celebrate Christmas in my household so I saw buying my daughters a brand new car as a massive commitment that I still do regret at times, but I upheld my promise and will not be asking for money back. She said she hated me because she could not get the loans needed for a certain college and had to settle for something lower. \\n\\nChloe accepted a loan and is generally thankful as her student loads would have been significantly more costly, she has a great relationship with my other daughter yet I only speak to Chloe as of lately. To make a long story short, I am seen as stingy and selfish, but I do not believe this to be true. There are many sight-seeing spots and attractions in this area and they decided to hop in their rented vehicle and drive around, this was the second day as the first day they were resting from jet-lag.\\n\\nShe finished drying her hair, her husband and I were sitting near the front door and making small-talk. Nothing personal at all. As they were about to leave, I asked my daughter to pay me forty dollars to look over her two children. She began to laugh, yet I was serious. Her husband began to shake his head and scoff, muttering something to her, something I imagine he has had a-lot of practice in talking about behind my back. I told him to be quiet in not so good words, she snapped at me. He made a joke about loaning me money, this was enough. I told him to get out. My daughter asked me to calm down and her husband yelled that Chloe was going to become like my other daughter and '' disown '' me, this turned into a verbal fight that almost became physical. I told her that I am doing a job for her and am asking to be paid, and that if she did not pay me for this I would charge her for staying at my home, which is in a well-off area. This led to them packing their bags and bringing their children to a local hotel. We have not spoken since. \\n\\n\",\n",

Because of him I\\'ve started hiking, geocaching, actually started cooking food instead of just heating it up, been sketching more and just generally more involved in my art and life. And I have been kind of holding on, hoping to get that commitment from him, but this is not what I had in mind.\\n\\nI recently switched birth control methods and I guess I was wrong about how protected I was during the switch because I just found out on Wednesday that I am pregnant. I\\'m not sure how far along yet but I have literally taken four tests, all positive, so I\\'m sure this is really happening. I told my not-bf right away and it was an instant 180 with him.

Not-bf is basically a changed man as far as commitment goes but I\\'m worried it\\'s too little, too late.

Yesterday we had our first viewing of an house and I asked my parents to come along because my dad has already bought three houses (sold one, currently living in one an renting on) - so he has plenty of knowledge and experience. \\n\\nThe estate agent I had talked to told me to meet him AT the house. So we arrived in time at were waiting at the house. Nobody arrived, it was raining and very cold, we waited for 5-6 minutes before ringing the bell. The owner opened up, we entered the yard that had some kind of roof and after 1-2 minutes the estate agent came and was like: yeah I had other customers and they were still looking so I couldn\\'t come out. \\n\\nMy dad is not a very easy going person, I know that. My mom was cold and he was pissed that the agent let us stand in the cold and in the rain so he in introduced himself and said: we were waiting in the rain. \\n\\nThe real estate agent was pissed and said: \"yeah four minutes that\\'s not much\". \\n\\nHe had house slippers on, so he wasn\\'t ready to come out to meet us anyways. \\n\\nMy dad told him: \"you made the appointment to meet you at the house at 5.30pm and its raining, you should have come out and meet us and we could have waited here under this roof until your customers were ready to leave. My wife was freezing and its pouring rain outside\".\\n\\nThe real estate agent got very defensive and said: \"well you should have called me\"\\n\\nMy dad got really mad because he is a salesman himself (Pharma) and he expected an apology. He got really mad and said: \"are you even a real estate agent?\"\\n\\nHere I jumped in and whispered to my dad in our native language that he should calm down please. My boyfriend isn\\'t from the same country as I am, but he learned the language and he should have noticed and should have understood that I told my dad to back off.\\n\\nThe real estate agent said: \"You know what? I don\\'t want you to come look at the house, we should call it quits.\" \\n\\nThis is were I jumped in and said: \"well technically we are your customers so I dont see why we shouldn\\'t see the house at least?\"\\n\\nSo the real estate agent calmed down a bit but told me we can look at the house, but my parents weren\\'t welcome inside. My parents got really mad and left, they said they dont have to be treated that way. \\n\\nAfter they left the agent said that he doesn\\'t want to sell us anything and we should leave. My boyfriend got scared and told him that he doesn\\'t know why my dad started this fight but that he doesn\\'t meant to be rude. I told the agent that we should leave the fight behind because its stupid and we want to at least get a look at the house.\\n\\nHe then told me: \"the least you can do is apologize for your father, you are giving me the feeling that you agree with him\".\\n\\nI kept quiet because I am not APOLOGIZING for my dad. \\n\\n1. I agree with him, the agent shouldn\\'t have left us in the pouring rain, thats not how you treat customers and my mom was really cold. The agent should have apologized.\\n2. I dont think my dad handled the situation very well, he was pissed and he shouldn\\'t have made himself the center of attention because it was OUR meeting with the agent\\n3. I think those things should be handled at home in private and I wanted to talk to my dad in private about how thats not cool that he got into a fight with the agent.\\n\\nMy boyfriend did. He did apologize for my dad and told the agent he is sorry and he didn\\'t know why my dad was acting this way. I didn\\'t say anything to him and we got to see the house (its not what we are looking for).\\n\\nOn the way back home from the meeting my BF told me that my dads reaction wasn\\'t cool. I told him he was right BUT that I though he (BF) acted REALLY unloyal and that pissed me off. I told him everything about how you dont call out family in front of others and how I wanted to talk to my dad in private. I told him that he stabbed my dad in the back and that you DONT do that in family. He said he disagrees with me and that my dad had nearly ruined everything for us and that he wanted to see the house and so he did everything so we could see him.\\n\\nWe should have watched a game at my parents and BF refused to go, telling me that he was mad at my dad. I went anyways.\\n\\nToday he asked if I had talked to my parents, and I did. My dad had apologized profoundly and said that he wasn\\'t in his place because it wasn\\'t his meeting. He apologized around 3-4 times, he was very sorry. But my mom told me that she didn\\'t like how my boyfriend tried to calm the agent down by telling him my dad was wrong. \\n\\nI told my BF again, that I didn\\'t like it either and that he acted poorly. He tells me that now he\\'s mad at ME for being mad at HIM because he thinks its not a matter of loyalty but my dad acting poorly and he was ashamed of my dad. \\n\\nSo HITAH? AITA?',\n",

I told her when she got it that I am not looking after it, I am pretty busy in my life and really don\\'t have time or any love for this animal. I really don\\'t like this dog living in my apartment but I love my girlfriend so I don\\'t moan. The thing wrecks my head, the constant snorting and wheezing, the begging for food, the constant need for attention drives me up the wall. I use the \"give a shit\" scale with my girlfriend when deciding which battles are worth fighting, so these things don\\'t affect me enough to argue about.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSoon after she got it, the dog started having health problems. As someone has never owned a dog I didn\\'t realise that these animals had so much issues (I looked it up and its common for those breeds of dogs). Initially I thought its because she never walks the dog and it is stuck in an apartment all day with her, so any illnesses she gets she would give it to the dog. I looked this up online too and its a load of bullshit, essentially the breed of dog has so much issues because it has been bred to be mentally deficient so that they are \"cute and docile\". Thing is honestly one of the ugliest things I have ever seen. The dog has had surgery about 3 times so far and the money involved is insane. I have always refused to pay for them as I don\\'t see it as my responsibility.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo down to the issue that has me and my gf fighting, the dog needs surgery on its face for some respiratory issues or some shit. She came to me crying saying she couldn\\'t afford it but I said why did you get a dog like this if you couldn\\'t afford it. She called me an asshole for not caring about her dog but I just told her to go fuck herself. She left the other day and took her dog with her, now she is staying in her parents house. I assume she will guilt trip her dad (who doesn\\'t make much money either) to pay for the dogs surgery, she has done this before when I refused to pay. The other day two of her friends were texting me calling me a wanker and said they were going to tell people I abused my girlfriend. I am not worried about this because they texted me so I just kept the messages. But this did make me question a couple of things and what my gf said about me behind my back. Haven\\'t broken up yet but feel it\\'s inevitable.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nReally I am just wondering who is the asshole in this situation? I don\\'t know if the dog could die but I don\\'t think it will, still I don\\'t feel it is my responsibility to take care of it. Even though it lived with me for a year and a half. ',\n",

He is the guy I can see marrying, having kids with and growing old together. He\\'s amazingly handsome, great job, athletic, charming and funny and amazing in bed. \\n\\nAfter we got done having sex last night he said he had something very awkward to ask me, I was a little worried that he was going to say something to ruin his seemingly perfect interior and exterior. But he said he wanted to talk about how many partners we\\'ve had in the past. I told him flat out I didn\\'t think it was very relevant and that I really like him now and that was all that mattered. He blurted out that I was only the second girl he\\'s ever been with (He\\'s 27, I\\'m 22). I was like blown away because as good as he is, I would figure he has broken hearts all across the country. \\n\\n\\nI told him I was not comfortable with this which he correctly took to mean I\\'d been with more than 2 people. He kept pressing and pressing and I kept trying to deflect but the problem was that each deflection made it seem like I\\'d had sex with more and more people.

       " 'Going to try to make this as short as possible while including details needed. \\n\\nI have been with my fianc√© for 6 years. Fianc√© has an older sister, we\\'ll call her Sally, who is 28 and has a 5 year old child. I was there the day Sally was in labor and Baby was born, she is my niece. His entire family has referred to me as his Auntie since day 1. I am not blood but we are family, she calls me Auntie and we have sleepovers, zoo visits, etc. \\n\\n2 years ago Sally was in rehab from drug addiction. Alcohol, pain killers, and Xanax were her thing. She had a mental breakdown and the family collected money to send her to rehab and all organized a schedule to take care of Baby. The baby\\'s dad, Sally\\'s boyfriend, has a welding/construction job and was out of town for 2 months so he wasn\\'t there for all of this. \\n\\nShe checked herself out after 3 days, insisting she was \"fine and just needed a safe withdraw\". I pick her up, take her to her house, and she immediately goes to smoke weed and drink a beer. I don\\'t think weed is a drug and am very pro-cannibas although I don\\'t smoke, but that was not appropriate considering I just picked her up from rehab. \\n\\nA week later she was fired for snorting in the bathroom., evicted for being 4 months late, totaled her car driving while high and is being sued for $50k from wrecking into a house, and was kicked out of Fianc√©\\'s other sister\\'s house for forgetting the sink was plugged up and running (she was high) and the entire downstairs was RUINED from water damage because nobody else came home for 8 hours. $20,000 of damage and thank god their house insurance covered it. \\n\\nThat was all last year. They\\'ve been in their new house on their own for about 6 months. In November she called FIL and said their electricity was shut off because she didn\\'t have the money because BF\\'s paycheck got messed up and didn\\'t go through. He paid their late electricity bills.. a total of $500. I thought it was suspiciously expensive but kept my mouth shut. All has been quiet since. \\n\\nTwo weeks ago, she asked me to borrow some money to get groceries for Niece. Of course I\\'m not going to let my niece or sister go hungry, no matter what is going on otherwise, so I say I\\'ll be over at 5. I got off work early and get there at 2:45. I come in using my spare key, walk in, see Niece playing with dolls in the corner, Sally passed out on the couch, and heroin on the coffee table. Unfortunately coming from a family riddled with addiction, I know what heroin looks like. I don\\'t know how much it was, but I could have scooped it up and filled my palm with it. I noticed radiators everywhere in the front room and Niece was in multiple layers of clothes and her winter jacket. The heat was off. The house was maybe 40F - it was 30 outside. \\n\\nI took Niece to my car, and called 911 for an ambulance as I was scared Sally was overdosing.  I didn\\'t want to alarm and freak out Niece so I stayed in the car and let her play on my phone until the ambulance arrived. Of course police and CPS showed up as well. I explained the situation and because Niece\\'s dad is out of town working, FIL/MIL were called. When they arrived they were quiet and cold, didn\\'t really talk, took Niece, and told me to go home. \\n\\nAn hour later I get home and fianc√© asks me what I\\'ve done. I explained everything to him and all he had was anger for me. Apparently the entire family already knew and were pissed at me for what I had done. Apparently I was \"out of line and stupid\" because I called 911 before seeing if she was actually OD\\'ing because it turned out she was just nodding out from the heroin. We fought for hours and I left and spent the night at my best friend\\'s house and cried all night. I couldn\\'t handle it all so I turned my phone off and tried to relax and just calm down. My best friend was up all night with me, telling me I did nothing wrong, and I\\'m okay. \\n\\nI turn my phone on and I had 65 texts/messages. MIL, FIL, SIL, fianc√©, and their extended family members blaming me. They are saying I ruined her life, ruined Niece\\'s life, made everything more complicated than it needed to be, made it public when it was a \"family affair\", and ruined Sally\\'s chances of ever getting cleaned or having custody of her child again, none of them ever want to see me again and I will never see my niece again, and they want me to pay for Sally\\'s jail bond and sue me for the CPS case and emotional damages.\\n\\nI am also now single. So on top of losing my best friend of 10 years (fianc√©), I will lose my apartment I had with him, what I considered my family, and my Niece.\\n\\nI truly feel horrible. I have horrible anxiety to the point where I\\'m worried someone is going to come get \"revenge\" on me for what I did. I can\\'t eat. I have lost 7 pounds from it. I\\'m not sleeping for shit. I have bags under my eyes. I\\'ve had 8 migraine-days in two weeks. At first I felt so confident in my decision but as the days go by I\\'m thinking maybe they were right and I should have checked on her before calling 911 and being frazzled. I don\\'t care about Sally anymore, but I did rip a 5 year old child away from her parents and I feel horrible about it. I know someone in the family will take her in, but it\\'s never like being with your parents. She will grow up resenting me for it and all I\\'ve ever done is love her as my own. \\n\\nReddit, AITA?

       " 'My girlfriend, D, and I have been together for three months. I\\'m caucasian and she is of Chinese descent (this is relevant later). She lives in a co-ed dorm, and one of her neighbors, J, has a longstanding infatuation with her. I\\'ve known about J since before we started dating, and D has (too gently, I think) let him down on several occasions. She doesn\\'t like to hurt people, which is admirable, but I think it\\'s prolonged his crush because she hasn\\'t been forceful enough in her desire to remain only friends. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n J is also of Chinese descent, which is part of his rationale for why they should date -- apparently it would make things \"easier\" for them to date within their own culture. Problem is, D has a pretty specific type: tall white guys. She of course hasn\\'t told J this specifically, but she did tell me that he really resents that white guys date \"all the good Asian girls.\" I can\\'t decide whether this is a legitimate concern or bellyaching on his part. I want to sympathize, but it\\'s hard because you can\\'t really choose who you\\'re attracted to.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI finally met J last week when D and I were heading out to an orchestra concert. We were both in full formalwear and D had high heels and a figure-forming dress on. We were on our way past the common area on her dorm floor and this guy walks up to her and just launches into a conversation. He doesn\\'t acknowledge me at all, no introduction, nothing. I\\'m trying to be polite and finally D introduces us and he just kind of gives me a \"what\\'s up\" nod. Okay, fine. He\\'s about her height when she has heels on - it\\'s obvious this guy really is not her type so I\\'m not feeling threatened. But then he asks if she\\'ll hold on for a minute, goes to his room, and comes back with a fucking teddy bear. He gives D the teddy bear, right in front of me, and said when he saw it, it made him think of her. She thanked him and we went to the concert (the teddy stayed in my car). \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow, I don\\'t think of myself as a mean person. Most people who know me would find meanness not in my character. But all during that concert, all I could think of was making J suffer -- not terribly, but just enough to back off. So, I hatched my plan. I knew D\\'s roommate would be out all week, which meant I would be able to stay over at her dorm. D and I started having sex on our second date. I have since learned that certain things will make her get very, very loud - to the point that she has to bite a pillow or risk sounding like she\\'s being \"murdered with sex,\" as she puts it. So, last night we had a very romantic evening out, and when we came back J was in his room with his door open studying. His room is directly north of D\\'s and the walls in the building are pretty flimsy. You can hear other people\\'s music or tv most of the time. She said \"Hey\" and then we both went into her room and closed the door. I proceeded to clear her bed of pillows, throw her down on it, and get down to business. I won\\'t go into graphic detail, but she was very much caught up in the moment, and when she looked for a pillow to bite, there was none. So she just let it all out. For like fifteen or twenty minutes.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAt this point we\\'re both giddy, and then it hits her. J was next door and she guessed he could hear everything. She immediately started feeling sad, worrying that hearing his crush in the throes of passion would be painful. I suggest that maybe that\\'s something he needed to hear, in order to make it clear that he will never, ever be considered a sexual option for her. This made her even sadder, and she started to go on about what a great person he was, how he is really very kind and would make someone very happy, etc. She starts to get pissed off at me and saying I\\'m being mean. I tell her I\\'m sorry, she\\'s right, and leave to go to the shared men\\'s room down the hall.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI walk past the common area and see J. He\\'s just staring at me with the most intense look of pure, burning hatred. So I give him an innocent \"what\\'s up\" nod and say, \"Hey man, is there a water fountain on this floor? I am super dehydrated,\" and wipe some of the remaining sweat from my forehead. And I truly believe he deserved all of this, but here\\'s where I wonder if I\\'m the asshole, because in that moment I was fucking thrilled to completely dunk on this dude. And that scared me a little, knowing there\\'s some dormant, primal part of me that just wants to be king. J, for his part, never did tell me where the water fountain was.',\n",

This is the timeline as near I can remember:\\n\\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO\\'s are invited. Cool, I can do that. \\n\\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it\\'s just a work party she tells me it\\'s cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \\n\\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it\\'s not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I\\'m starting to get a little WTF\\'y here. \\n\\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \\n\\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I\\'m hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company\\'s \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren\\'t you proud of me!\" \\n\\n\\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don\\'t drive! I\\'ll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn\\'t smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that\\'s a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I\\'ll send the car!\" \\n\\nMy fianc√© looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it\\'s all cool, I\\'ll just take the car service.\" \\n\\nI\\'m freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can\\'t go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I\\'m a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I\\'m not stupid. \\n\\nShe told me over and over again \"he\\'s married, he CAN\\'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you\\'re being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \\n\\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn\\'t come out for at least an hour. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do. I can\\'t beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she\\'d be freaking the fuck out and I\\'d see her reaction and just call it off.\\n\\n AITA?\\n\\nEdit: it\\'s 5:30 here, car service picked her up at 5:15. I guess it\\'s up to fate now if I\\'m a controlling asshole or if she didn\\'t see it whatever is coming coming.\\n\\nEdit 2: she just got home and said only \"I don\\'t want to fucking talk about it\" and she\\'s back talking to who I assume is her sister. I\\'m defying my every desire to eves drop so I don\\'t know what happened. It\\'s only 8:45 so I don\\'t think anything super crazy happened. I\\'m just glad she\\'s home. If it\\'s appropriate, I\\'ll update again when I know more.\\n\\nEdif3: this really doesn‚Äôt pertain to aita anymore rather just people asking for an update...she gets to dinner and it‚Äôs just she, coworker and boss in a private dining room at hotel. Boss says strait up hes banging other girl and wants fianc√© to join them. Has ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù with his wife and says he can do amazing things for fianc√©. Fianc√© is pissed she didn‚Äôt see this coming, but she‚Äôs still pissed at me for being controlling. She‚Äôs not happy at all and talking about breaking up. Sucks All around but I‚Äôm relieved she‚Äôs safe. Just giving her some space for a while.',\n",
       " 'My boyfriend and I recently moved to a new state, and in doing so spent a lot of money. He had just recently graduated college and had almost 0 saved so I took on a lot of the expenses, and we agreed he could pay me back a little each month.  I do make more than him, with a full time corporate job and a side hustle of freelance graphic design but we do split everything evenly.  He isn‚Äôt good with saving but he has been working on it and has managed to save up a little bit (which is now suppose to be going to a major car repair he has been putting off for months). It is worth noting that every time bills come due or rent is taken out or I ask for my monthly ‚Äúmoving payback fee‚Äù he whines and moans about being broke.  He also keeps putting things on his credit card so he always has to pay back a bunch each month. Final add on- we discussed a month ago to start saving an extra funds to go on a nice trip later this year. I have cut back on all extra spending and have saved up quite a bit already and was expecting the same.\\n\\nSo this brings me to today. His boss every year takes a few employees on a hunting trip to Texas, which my boyfriend was really excited for. He doesn‚Äôt have a gun currently, since all the ones he used for hunting in the past were borrowed from his dad, and he had planned on just borrowing one for this trip. Or so I thought. \\n\\nHe left the apartment to go ‚Äúto wander‚Äù around Cabela‚Äôs and was gone for almost 4 hours. He has casually mentioned maybe looking at getting a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù gun for the trip because he didn‚Äôt want to ask to borrow one. He comes home and lets me know he bought a $1000 gun.  What. \\n\\nI am furious. He definitely doesn‚Äôt have that kind of money and will only be using this gun once, until next years hunting trip. (We live in a big city and he really can‚Äôt go hunting near us). He still has the car to fix and still owes me over $600 from moving costs. He says it‚Äôs not my money so I can‚Äôt have an opinion. While this is true, we do live together and share costs and so when one of us is financially struggling it puts burden on the other. I wish he would have thought this out more. I would never go out right now in our current situation and buy a $1000 purse?!\\n\\nTLDR; broke bf bought $1000 gun for a one time trip while still owing me money and despite previous plans that we are saving for a big trip.

       " 'We went away on a family trip for 7.5 weeks. We hired a work associate‚Äôs 23-year old daughter to house sit for us.  Her only real responsibilities were to get the 1) mail, 2) feed the cat twice per day, and 3) scoop the litter box at least once per day and wash it out at least once per week. This was explained to her when we had her over for dinner as part of the interview process and in clearly written instructions.\\n\\nOur cat is very well behaved and we made it very clear that if his litter box is neglected he will pee somewhere else, which will be nasty. This was reiterated on the written instructions (item #2, right after feeding instructions in bold). \\n\\nWe came back to a home reeking of cat urine on every floor; but not from one or two spots, but in 10 spots - rugs and bath mats all with multiple stains and of varying ages, which all had to be tossed. Further, our cork-based flooring doesn‚Äôt seem to be coming clean even after a 10-hour soak with an enzyme-based cleaner that I fear that it will never get clean. I‚Äôm also very worried that I will lose both my pet and damage deposits (collectively, 1.5 months rent). \\n\\nI‚Äôve spent nearly two days trying to clean up this mess, including my expected first day back to work. \\n\\nI‚Äôve told the cat sitter that although she did some of the tasks required of her (mail and feeding of the cat), she utterly failed on the litter box front and the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that she was beyond negligent in this task. As a result of her failure and my ongoing cleaning efforts, I told her that she cannot be reasonably expected to be paid (about $1,000). \\n\\nHer mother, the business associate whom I am a client of, says that I‚Äôm being an unreasonable, it‚Äôs the cats fault, and that her daughter should be paid the full amount originally agreed to. \\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: The arrangement with the sitter was that she was to live in house while we were gone. \\n\\nEdit 2: Sitter says she followed the instructions, but the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that she didn‚Äôt. Going thru her texts, it looks like she cleaned the litter box every 3 days and washed it once per week. Verbal and written instructions were for her scoop litter box at least once per day and wash once per week. \\n\\nEdit 3: Sitter says that when she did find pee (she says there were three locations that she was aware that the cat urinated outside of the box, but that she cleaned it up. Inspection of those areas just shows that they were cleaned poorly as there was dried visible urine there. \\n\\nEdit 4: mother has written that she incurred expenses looking after our cat, including gas for her car driving to and from our place. I think that confirms she wasn‚Äôt staying here as agreed. \\n\\n**Update 1**\\n\\nFollowing the advice of some of the posters here, I reached out to the sitter and walked through the state of our home, the locations of the stale and fresh urination zones - all with multiple events - for example, I made the mistake of buying a black light to help trace where the urine ran to after I pulled out the dishwasher, stove, and kitchen baseboards - and you could see pulses and concentric circles - gross.\\n\\nShe has apologised profusely, admits there were smells that she didn‚Äôt really investigate, which she now regrets not doing so, and agrees that she utterly failed in her job and understands why she should not be paid. \\n\\nAfter three days of soaking and blotting with speciality cleansers, I‚Äôve thrown the towel in on attempting anymore remedial work myself. Professional pet odour people are coming Thursday to assess and tell us if they can remediate or if the flooring needs to be ripped up, base boards replaced, and cabinets pulled out. It‚Äôs crazy. Will update again after Thursday. \\n\\n**Update 2**\\n\\nWe had a professional cleaning service come and treat all the areas of urination with a chlorine dioxide solution, which sounds scarier than it actually is. Apparently it is a powerful oxidiser and antibacterial that we were told is what grocery stores mist into produce. They guaranteed everything except the kitchen floor because it was a type of cork and because the urine was coming from under the sink. \\n\\nWell, every room but the kitchen seems to have been successfully remediate except for the kitchen where we still get the frequent face shot / strong wiff of cat piss. Ugh. We also had them come back and treat the air, too. $525 including taxes for both treatments.\\n\\nNext piece of work is to shampoo the carpets (cat ran thru it‚Äôs piss puddle and it‚Äôs all over the stairs as we discovered with a black light). The cleaning service also instructed us to replace the baseboards in the kitchen, which they say may help with the smell.\\n\\nWe were generally pleased with the results of chlorine dioxide treatment and would recommend it to anyone trying to get out any stubborn or vile smells.

       " 'Okay so a little context, I‚Äôm 23 in a serious relationship and have a whole host of medical issues. I‚Äôve never wanted a kid, even at age 5 I found the idea of baby dolls etc just ugh. This idea evolved and changed as I did and eventually developed into where I am now which is even if I wanted one having one with my medical issues would just be dumb and dangerous for everyone involved. \\n\\nMy cousin is the eldest of us all and has always been a family woman (honest to god I see nothing wrong with that, it‚Äôs just not for me) she‚Äôs happily married and is expecting her first. And so the family has gone into a bit of a baby craze. \\n\\nI live quite far so I‚Äôve avoided most of the madness, but I went to see them all last weekend with a knitted blanket I‚Äôd made for her as a gift. This started the comments: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre obviously very mummsie think of what you could make for your own‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôd be a great mum‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs what you were born to do‚Äù ‚Äúoh your opinion will change when you‚Äôre older‚Äù \\nTo all of this I just laughed and made jokes just trying to get past the awkward but it‚Äôs a full 4 hours of these little gripes till my cousin says: ‚ÄúHonestly [my name] you‚Äôre so stubborn, believe me in a few years all your ‚Äúopinions‚Äù will change then that job of yours won‚Äôt matter. I just hope it‚Äôs not to late and you don‚Äôt end up alone and bitter. Honestly having a kid is the best thing a woman can do and nothing can compare‚Äù \\n\\nThis really angered me so I (somewhat tipsy and just kinda very done) snapped back ‚Äúwell sorry I have more ambition than being a breeder, have fun with a wrecked vagina‚Äù she broke down crying and that pretty much put an end to the family gathering. \\n\\nI feel horrid about it all and I really didn‚Äôt mean it. She‚Äôs always wanted a family and I‚Äôm so happy for her but I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve always respected her choices and she‚Äôs never respected mine and it kinda popped at the worst moment. I really want to say sorry but she‚Äôs now posting these really pathetic and snide fb posts and i really am just kinda tired. \\n\\nSmall note: my cousin and that side of the family knows about my medical conditions, I even brought them up to point out how unsafe it would be. But they still continued. I know that doesn‚Äôt excuse what I did but I hope it explains why I got so angry. \\n\\nTDLR: at a family gathering and got crap for not wanting children, I snapped at my pregnant cousin and now she‚Äôs posting all of this stuff on fb and I just want the whole ordeal to be over. \\n\\nUpdate: hi, everyone, after reading some of the results and giving it some time I sent my cousin a message saying sorry and explaining why I snapped, it actually lead to a really nice and probably needed conversation with her. \\n\\nUpdate: okay so this kinda blew up, I just want to clarify things as I think sometimes my meaning wasn‚Äôt put across or I just didn‚Äôt use the right words and answer a lot of the points you guys have: \\n Believe me it was 4 hours as it started as soon as I gave her the gift. no matter what the conversation changed to (and I tried to change it a lot)it would always get brought back around. I did ask people to stop and some of the family backed me up but there was just the persistent few who kept going. Maybe my tone was to light or it just wasn‚Äôt taken seriously enough as we do tend to be a very snarky family that states our minds.\\n  I could not leave the gathering, It would have heavily insulted everyone there and lead to a huge family blow out (bigger than the one currently) so the idea of walking away never really even came into my head. Honestly I thought I could just put up with it and bite my tongue but evidently I was wrong in the end.\\n   Yes I do know vaginas aren‚Äôt wrecked after giving birth. In that moment I was lashing out and just aiming to hurt her as much as she hurt me.\\n    Lastly I‚Äôm not against mothers etc it‚Äôs just not for me in anyway. ',\n",

Which makes children more responsible around guns.\\n\\nMy ex-wife on the other hand, grew up in an anti-gun house. I've respected her wishes and had my entire collection relocated to my uncle's house. She acted like sharing my passion with my children was a completely taboo subject. It  was a no argument conversation I wasn't even allowed to bring it up. I also respected that our entire marriage.\\n\\nMy son is ADHD bipolar, and also has Asperger's Syndrome. Raising him has been quite a challenge. I was raised a certain way, and I try to raise my children the same way. I'm a little strict, and it shows with my daughter, because she is very respectful polite and intelligent. My son on the other hand, him and I have a very complicated relationship. He's obsessed with Legos, and he pretty much just does his own thing. We have very little in common, and hardly spend any time together.\\n\\nNow that I got my own place, I brought all my guns back. This is my house, she got the government involved in our marriage, and she is no longer in control of what I do. My son is my responsibility. I bought him a 22 rifle and gave it to him for his birthday. \\n\\nI took him to the gun range, myself and a trained professional taught him everything there is to know about gun safety. Then I taught my son how to safely shoot a rifle. I think he is hooked on a new hobby, he had the same look in his eye, as I did as a little boy. He's quite a shot, and I think you'll make a great hunter one day.\\n\\nOf course my ex-wife thinks I'm a huge asshole, but what about Reddit?\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'My childhood home is behind a really nice private school. This school has bought up surrounding property before to build a gym, soccer field, etc. But I have never really been approached myself about selling for that. \\n\\nAnyways, when I got married, my Mom had just suffered a stroke and was unable to live by herself. My husband and I moved in right after our honeymoon and stayed with her for three years until she moved into a retirement home. She is doing great and has recovered nicely. \\n\\nHowever, she could not afford to keep the house, so she offered to sell it to us siblings. My brother had no interest, his wife owns a house and he travels all the time. My sister showed some interest but didn\\'t have the means. I mentioned to my FIL that we wanted to buy the house, but sadly probably had to move out when a new owner was found. \\n\\nMy FIL bought the house for us. We own it outright. The only condition is that when we sell the property, my FIL has first dibs. \\n\\nWell, the time has come for us to leave the little house behind. We have been in it almost ten years and are planning to head to Texas, where my husband rents out homes and we have a property that someone moved out of. So we are in the process of talking to my FIL about the house. \\n\\nMy sister heard we are selling it to my FIL and has been pitching an absolute fit. Which I understand why, my FIL plans to sell the house to the school behind us for twice what he is buying it for. Which I think makes sense, as he is recouping the money originally spent \\\\[to give us the house\\\\] and generously offering $100K for the house so we can move. \\n\\nMy sister has put in an offer of $160K, and has been pestering me for weeks about selling it to her. She is heartbroken that we are allowing the house to be torn down. She is refusing to let us see the nephews and thinks I can just tell FIL to fuck off. \\n\\nIt\\'s in the contract. We are not even offering the house up \"for sale\" to the public. FIL has informed the school of our timeline \\\\[nine months until we move\\\\] and they have offered a price. We are getting 100K, the rest is going to FIL. \\n\\nAITA for telling my sister is she can\\'t accept the house isn\\'t really mine to begin with...? ',\n",

I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\\n\\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir.

When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\\n\\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\\n\\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him.

Anyway one day in class last week she decides to talk me and out of nowhere she says ''You are quite a weirdo aren't you, if you keep playing video games all day you will stay a loser virgin''. \\n\\nMy initial response in my head was WTF?

However some of her friends (mostly all guys) came up to me and said I am a horrible misogynist douche for saying what I said and that I owe her a real apology, I just told them to fuck off as well. \\n\\nThis has caused some tension with some of her female friends too, who said I am being evil. \\n\\nWas I wrong here? I thought what I did was justified given the circumstances for what I did but it has caused some issues with people.\\n\\n**TLDR - Called a girl bully a slut and that her dad would be ashamed of her after SHE sexually shamed me for being a virgin loser who plays video games...given detention because I didn't apologize, tensions with school mates.**\",\n",

Ever since my wife was 5, she's danced as a hobby and even now, she still dances 2 nights per week and also teaches dances on Saturdays. We both work full-time jobs and during the day, our kids go to daycare. Because of my schedule, though, I get Fridays off, so the kids stay home with me on those days instead.\\n\\nSome background on the situation:\\n\\nMy wife dances on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after work. She doesn't even come home - she goes straight from work to dance. So I pick the kids up, make them dinner, give them baths, and put them both to bed. And on Saturdays, I get the kids up, get them dressed, fed, play with them, and generally just try to keep them alive until my wife comes home from teaching at around 2:30pm.\\n\\nNone of this is a big deal. I totally understand and appreciate her need to dance for her mental and emotional well-being.\\n\\nBut here's my AITA dilemma:\\n\\nOn top of that, there are usually 1-2 nights per week that my wife will be. Some examples:\\n\\n- Work dinners/staff meetings that she has to attend\\n- Going out with her friends for dinner or drinks\\n- Getting a massage after dance on Saturday\\n\\nSo this works out to 3-4 nights per week where I'm taking care of the kids by myself plus having them along all day on Fridays and most of the day on Saturdays.\\n\\nWe have talked about this and she insists that I could go out a few nights a week and leave her alone with the kids, but the thing is that I don't want to go out. It's so rare that we're all home together, so when we are, I just want to enjoy time with the family.\\n\\nSo what do you think, Reddit?

This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn\\'t obsessed with herself. She\\'s funny, charming, and smart.

Secondly, I'm on mobile, so excuse any formatting errors.\\n\\nBit of a background, I've decided a few years back, after a major pregnancy scare, that I'm not gonna leave something like this to chance, and I've got a vasectomy.\\n\\nFast forward 5 years, I'm in a relationship with this girl, our 1 year anniversary is coming up, and she decides to spring up on me, that she is pregnant. To this day, I'm amazed that I've kept my calm. I'm not going to lie here, I'm not a saint, in fact, I'm a pretty vindictive person. My first course of action was asking if she considered an abortion. After her stating, that having a child was one of her top priorities, the case was pretty much clear to me.\\n\\nThe whole gist of the matter, in my country, abortions are allowed until 16 weeks in. So I've waited, and bid my time to strike. I've waited the whole 16 weeks to make sure, then confronted her with the following: either we get a paternity test, or she fucks off immediately. Now I know that even a vasectomy isn't 100% safe, so I was fully prepared to take responsibility if the child was actually mine. Well, seems like I'm never going to know, as she vehemently refused testing, and broke down crying after me kicking her out.\\n\\nTL;DR Girlfriend cheated on me, got pregnant, I've tricked her into believing that I belive it's mine until she couldn't abort anymore, then unceremoniously kicked her out and cut contact.\\n\\nSo, am I really the Asshole here?\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Wow, first of all, thank you for the platinum and gold, though totally unnecessary, as this is a throwaway.\\n\\nSomething to clarify here, no, I didn't tell her about my vasectomy, why should I? Being together for a year, (I'm from a German speaking country) is not long at all in our culture. Most people marry after 7-8 years of being in a relationship, many people even have children without ever getting married. What I'm trying to say, I've had longer relationships than this one in my teenage years.\\n\\nAlso, I think I should clarify, that after kicking her out, I've called her parents, and laid down all the facts. They weren't happy, but did understand my decision, as her mother got cheated on in her first marriage. They've showed up a few days after kicking her out, I've let them take her belongings, and after that, never heard from them again.\\n\\nAlso, the argument that paternity testing is dangerous doesn't really apply, since I was prepared to pay for noninvasive testing, which can be done with the mother's blood alone. \",\n",

This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \\n\\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she\\'s in a hetero relationship, she\\'s not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it\\'s one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can\\'t understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She\\'s very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn\\'t straight just cause she\\'s with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\\n\\nI told her I didn\\'t like her going to pride as if she\\'s gay, being around gay females who will assume she\\'s gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can\\'t expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \\n\\nShe told me that she couldn\\'t see a future with me if I\\'m forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn\\'t gay until she\\'s in a gay relationship. Maybe, I\\'m wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It\\'s the same thing. I feel as if she\\'s saying our relationship isn\\'t enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \\n\\nShe\\'s stormed out and hasn\\'t been home since an hour ago. I\\'m wondering if I\\'m the asshole for feeling like this? \\nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \\n\\nEdit - maybe it is a cultural thing.

I can see that my mom hated me for choosing to stay with my father. \\n\\nSkip a few years later and I‚Äôm 17 and living with my father still. Over the years my father slowly started drinking his pain away and it took a toll on him and me. He became an abusive father telling me that I remind him of ‚ÄúHer‚Äù which is my mom but I stayed because I loved my dad and I promised to be with him no matter what.\\n\\nI tried to keep in touch with my sisters however my mom hated that idea. I felt like my mom brainwashed my sisters to hate me for choosing my dad over her but I didn‚Äôt care. I tried to talk to my sisters over the phone, drive to their place and hang out with them because they were still my family. Except one day I went over to my moms house to see my sisters and my mom, however she pulled me aside privately telling me its best to stay away from them because I would bring my dads influence and I won‚Äôt be a good role model to my younger sisters. She told me that she doesn‚Äôt want to see me around ever and to stop hanging around my sisters and that broke my heart. \\n\\nA year later I turned 18, and things just got worse, my dad became more angrier with the world and I was scared everyday locking my room, sometimes I‚Äôll just spend nights in my car just to get away because I was afraid of what he becomes when he drinks. One day I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, I decided to pack my things and just leave because I don‚Äôt have a family anymore. I asked one my online video game buddy who lived 4 states away from me, if he would take a stranger into his home. He told me that I am family and he welcomed me into his family. \\n\\nThe day I decided to leave I told my dad that I‚Äôm leaving and I‚Äôm never coming back. The look he gave me, I could tell his soul just dropped out of his body. He just looked dead. I packed what little I had and went into my car. Lastly, I went to my moms house and she was there alone and my younger siblings were at school. I told her that I‚Äôm leaving and I‚Äôm not coming back to this f#cked up family. That day she asked me if I finally got tired of my dads shit and just told me to she doesn‚Äôt want to see me either. I just felt disgusted and just depressed. I tried to a be a son to my mother and father, I tried to be a brother but I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore.  That day I left to my friends home driving 21 hours straight, just crying. I arrived at my friends house and a week later I get a call from my uncle that my father committed suicide. I was devastated and blamed myself for his death because I promised to never leave his side.\\n\\nYears later I‚Äôm 23, it‚Äôs been 5 years and not once I received a call from my mom or my sisters about my whereabouts or how I‚Äôm doing.  They didn‚Äôt bother come looking for me, nothing. Except one day my younger sister found me on social media and texted me through Facebook. She told me mom had developed pancreatic cancer and doesn‚Äôt have much time left. I kept in contact with my younger sister because I still gave a damn about my family deep inside me. I would text her about how everyone is doing, especially how was mom doing. We exchange numbers and we would call each other here and there. \\n\\nOne day I get a call from my younger sister and it happens to be my own mother. She tells me that she isn‚Äôt doing so good, she doesn‚Äôt know how much time she has left and apologizes for being a bad mother towards me. She told me she wishes she could see me one last time before she passes away and in that moment, what she said just destroyed me. I responded by telling her No, I won‚Äôt come see you and that this is what she wanted and I just hung up the phone.  Days later i get a call from my younger sister telling me that mom passed away and was crying a lot and I‚Äôm an asshole for not being there for my own mom, I told her that she doesn‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôve been put through and I haven‚Äôt talked to my younger sister ever since then. \\n\\nTL: DR: My mom‚Äôs dying wish was for me to come see her before she passes away, I told her no because of our past differences and my younger sisters tells me I‚Äôm an asshole and haven‚Äôt spoke to me since.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

You're answers were overwhelmingly positive (save for a few), and today I finally solidified my position and pulled the trigger. \\n\\nFirst the good - When I returned home, I searched the box that I had hid the pictures and scrapbook to find that they were gone. Upon inquiring of their whereabouts, I was directed under a bathroom sink. There I found the remains of the scrapbook, mostly put back together. However, I realized that at least 2 pages were missing. I also noticed that a few pictures in question weren't present. Upon questioning, I was directed to a trash can, where I found a couple torn pictures. Still, to my dismay, I found that the contents of the ravaged scrapbook were still incomplete. Further investigation revealed another stash of torn pictures. Finally, I have attained all of the pictures. (Shout out to the private messages offering to reconstruct them. A massive thanks to you!)\\n\\nTwo more days passed and I demanded that she apologize to my daughter for destroying the scrapbook (which now resides in my daughters room). Apology accepted, now comes the hard part. \\n\\nI wont bother lying to you all, for I fear you would see through me. I considered trying to work through it. I thought, perhaps her efforts to repair the scrapbook are worthy of forgiveness? \\n\\nNAY!\\n\\nSeriously guys. I cant thank you enough.

The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we\\'ve taken care of him ever since.\\n\\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise.

He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have.

The jokes all seemed lighthearted and I just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she\\'d change her mind. Fast forward to our 20 week scan. We go in super excited and nervous. I don\\'t mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. \\n\\nWe go in and find out we are having a boy. My wife immediately bursts into tears and I hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. She doesn\\'t stop crying the whole day.

It\\'s just such an overreaction. I told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn\\'t going to change. She cried and called me an asshole. I told her she needs to get a grip. I felt awful but I feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous. \\n\\nMy wife and I made up but she\\'s still acting the same and I\\'m getting upset again. \\n\\nAITA for being upset about this?

       " 'I literally just found this sub today and I hope I am following all the rules. I am not looking for any sort of absolution or advice because really nothing can be done at this point. I just want to know if the feelings I have are justified...hence: am I the asshole. \\n\\nSix years ago I was 22 and started dating the absolutely most perfect guy on the planet. Saw sparks immediately, fell hard for him within the first few dates, he says he fell just as hard. We had an amazing first year courtship. I mean literally out of a fairytale romance novel. I was so in love with him I could not see strait. \\n\\nSo exactly one year in, his high school sweetheart shows up on the scene with a baby she claims is his. The timing of it was right from the last time he\\'s seen her (kid was about 2 years old) and she claimed that she didn\\'t know who the baby\\'s father was at first but now was certain it was him and she needed him in his life. This part of the story could go on for pages but fast forward to the baby wasn\\'t his, DNA test proved it. It was some sort of crazy girl shakedown because the real father wouldn\\'t buy her a car or some such craziness that people get themselves into. \\n\\nI was so relieved and figured our relationship would continue unabated after this minor bump in the road. However the baby scare freaked him the fuck out. He claimed he was still in love with me but he\\'d seen into the face of fatherhood and commitment and he just wasn\\'t ready and broke up with me. I was devastated beyond words. Like couldn\\'t eat sleep, eat or even breathe. He went off on a summer vacation to solo travel around Europe. About two weeks in, I decided I couldn\\'t be without him so I texted him that I needed to talk. He didn\\'t respond right away so maybe two days later I texted him back that I was super late, was probably pregnant and I wasn\\'t asking for him to come back, I just wanted him to be aware. I 100% was not pregnant.  \\n\\nHe called me immediately and asked what my plans were. I told him that I planned on getting an abortion but I felt like he should know. He told me to not do anything rash and that he would change his ticket and come home as soon as he was able. So when he got home he told me that he loved me, that he wanted to be with me, that his ex-GF scare wasn\\'t my fault and he was sorry he bolted and that he wanted to keep the baby. I really hadn\\'t planned for that happening that quickly. \\n\\nSo perhaps fortunately I got my period maybe two weeks later and was able to convince him that he blood was probably a miscarriage. I told him I was too scared to disappoint him and pretended to drive myself to planned parenthood where I concocted a fake miscarriage story. He never asked for any proof but he was deeply upset that the \"baby\" didn\\'t make it. \\nI pretended to be upset by the \"miscarriage\" too.\\n\\nWe pretty quickly both realized that it was probably for the best and our relationship more or less picked up where it had left off before. We aren\\'t not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but I truly love him. He supports me in my career and now being a stay at home mom, he\\'s amazing, he\\'s wonderful and I can\\'t live without him. We got married about 3.5 years ago.\\n\\n\\nSo in December we had our first baby, an amazingly beautiful little boy who we both adore. My husband is amazing father and is willing to sacrifice just about any material good so I can be a SAHM. Everything we have is amazing. He\\'s in the Navy, we live in an amazing little beach side community in California, he\\'s a wonderful dad. I could not ask for more. \\n\\nBut I know in my heart all of it is based on a lie.

       " \"So, my girlfriend is 19, I'm 22. Her dad had suffered from cancer for around 16 years but was severely ill for the past 3. My girlfriend's mum loves abroad so she was his full time carer for her dad and kinda just gave her life to him. \\nHe could no longer remember who she is or toilet himself. She just took it all on her stride, I've still never seen her cry and I lived with her and her dad at the end. \\n\\nHe died one morning when I was asleep and she was kinda in shock I think. \\n\\n She had to pay for the funeral herself and arrange it all. We different religiously, she is an atheist and I was raised Catholic. Her dad was also atheist and requested to be buried in a cardboard box, no headstone or religious speak. She arranged a woodland burial. \\n\\nI told her I wouldnt go because it makes me uncomfortable, to me it is awful to be burying him in that way. I understand that it's her choice and totally respect that but when she assumed I'd be there with her I told her that I'd rather not go because it is so far removed from an appropriate funeral, in my opinion. \\n\\nShe says I'm being selfish and putting my religion before her feelings and our relationship. I told her I'll drop her off, pick her up and support her throughout her grievance but I just don't want to go to the funeral. She hadn't spoken to me since. \\n\\nAITA? \\n\\n\\nEdit - I love this woman. She is the strongest, most powerful woman I've ever met. I hate seeing her in so much pain and I admire her ability to hold it together. I also admire how keen she is to respect her father's wishes. I believe that she is doing the right thing for her and that she should grieve and pay respects in any way that works for her. But, this isn't about me and I don't need to be there. I understand why she is doing it and I wish to help her through this grief but I shouldn't be expected to throw away my beliefs to suit her, nor would I expect her to, say, come to church for my sake. \\n\\nEdit 2 - for clarity; the woodland burial is a wicker casket, buried underground in a Forrest or woodland left for vegetation, trees, flowers to grow from the soil. In my girlfriend's case, he planted flowers in the plot in the belief that his death, his body, creates new life in the form of nature. There is not markings , no names, nothing. The idea is you don't even know the specific area that the deceased is buried, you just go to the woods and see the life that came from them. That's how my girlfriend explained it anyway, and it sounds great for her, and for her father. But, it is not appropriate in my religious to just abandon a body underground. I don't want to tell her she's wrong for doing it, but I believe there is a lack of respect for her father's body, his memory and his spirit. \",\n",
       " \"Hey. So, this happened a couple weeks ago but I can't help mulling it over once or twice a day. Here's the situation:\\n\\nMe and a five friends play tabletop RPGs every two weeks, and have been doing this for the past year and a half or so. We use a Discord server to organize these things, and also to talk to one another between sessions on that server. I'm the person who DMs these sessions. Out of the five players four are fine, but one of them is a little problematic. Let me call him Steven. Steven has a hard time getting into character and has on two or three occasions gotten pretty mad at himself for messing things up during a session, as he takes it really hard when he feels like he 'failed' the group. Despite this, Steven is by far and away the most enthusiastic player in the group and he tries his damnedest not to fuck things up and to contribute something to the game. Steven also suffers from some mental health issues, and though I don't exactly know which ones he has been pretty open about this to us and how it effects him--he shuts down, isolates himself, that sort of stuff. \\n\\nNow, three weeks ago, Steven suddenly left the Discord server without saying a word to any of us. One of the other four players, Alica, texted with Steven for a bit and conveyed to me he was having a depressed streak and was going to be away for a short period of time. I told Alica to say to Steven that we'd give him all the time he'd need and that he was welcome back anytime.\\n\\nAfter all the issues I've had with Steven over the year, though, I saw in his leaving the server the chance to replace him for someone I knew to be a better player. He could've stayed, but he left, so there was a spot free right? I invited someone else onto the Discord server to take Steven's spot. Some days later, Steven texted me about rejoining and asked me for an invitation link. I told him that I interpreted his leaving the server as implicitly leaving our tabletop sessions, too. When he told me this wasn't at all what he had intended, I told him that I had banned him from playing again because he was a bad player who doesn't know how to take a hint when he does something wrong and doesn't seem to learn very well from his mistakes. I told him I'd allow him to stay on the server, though, since we still all talk there, but I told him no on doing any more sessions.\\n\\nAfter this, Steven explained to me the exact scenario of him leaving in an attempt to make me feel compassionate; he felt that he was on the brink of harming himself and felt like he had to isolate himself and have some peace and quiet for a while. To achieve this he left the server and muted every social media he had so that he could have a few days where he could get back to being okay, then intended to rejoin.\\n\\nI didn't budge. Then, Steven told me that he thinks I acted extremely two-facedly by saying I'll welcome him back one day then booting him the other. He told me it feels like I was waiting for the first chance to ban him and blame it on himself. He told me that I'm a bad friend and that he blames me for never bothering to send him a message about how or if he wanted to continue with our tabletop games, or how he was doing, and also said that me not doing this really hurt him because he expected more from me. He also reminded me of how highly he values the sometimes up to seven hours that we spend together as a group and how much he was going to miss that. He pleaded with me to accept him back into the group. Again I told him no. After this Steven told me that it felt like he had lost a friend and that I was a *two-faced opportunist twat*, and I've not spoken to him since then. \\n\\nAlica, who does still regularly talk to him, told me that Steven's taken his banning pretty hard and has been sullen for a while, possibly even self-mutilating again---she doesn't know this for certain but has a suspicion due to some things he offhandedly mentioned.\\n\\nTruth be told, I don't feel like much of an asshole and feel like I'm justified in my actions. I took the shot and improved the situation for myself. If Steven had wanted to make sure I didn't ban him he should've stayed, he could've just muted the server right? And him being mad at me for not texting him, it's not like it's my responsibility to do that. It's him who should've let *me* know what was going on and how he wanted to proceed. \\n\\nTwo friends I've shared it with think I acted sub-optimally in this situation, and the players themselves has been largely silent about it. In fact the whole server has been pretty quiet, since Steven usually started and maintained the conversations there. I'm picking up vibes from Alica that she's also less than satisfied with Steven having been banned from the group. \\n\\nReddit, let me know if I acted right, or if I'm the asshole. \\n\\n**TL;DR** - Player inexplicably exited the groupchat we use for our biweekly tabletop games. I took this chance to replace him, as he's not an ideal player. He wanted to come back, and I told him he is a bad player and denied that request. He's now mad at me, obviously thinks I'm the asshole. Am I?\",\n",
       " 'Title should say *wanting to leave* my girlfriend\\n\\nFirst and foremost, I know that it takes a lot of courage to open up about sexual kinks and fetishes, and normally even if I wasn\\'t into something I would be supportive and encourage my partner to tell me. But I feel like everyone has some hard limits that would change the way they look at their partner, and once something is said you can\\'t really control how you feel about it or pretend you never heard it.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I have had a pretty solid relationship and a good sex life. Our hard limits have always been pretty fleshed out, and one of mine is that I would never be down to open our relationship which she knew. Recently out of the blue my girlfriend essentially told me she wanted to cuckold me. Told me that she had been watching videos and reading forums and was turned on by it. She went on to say how hot she thinks it\\'d be if she made me watch her sleep with other dudes, \"playfully\" humiliated me, talked about chastity and all that stuff. I was completely stunned and disgusted, and told her that I was absolutely not interested and I didn\\'t want to talk about it again, that it was a very firm no. I tried to put it out of my head but my stomach was doing flip flops. \\n\\nTwo days later she brought it up again, this time trying to reason with me and explain why it would be great for us and how much she\\'d like it, and how she could \"prove\" to me I\\'d like it. I got upset and told her that I already said no and she knew I\\'d never be ok with it, and I needed her to stop asking. She dropped it.\\n\\nI\\'ve been trying to let it go but I can\\'t. Knowing my girlfriend thinks so little of me that she\\'d want to not only sleep with other men but derive sexual pleasure from humiliating me during the act. It makes me wonder if something already happened, makes me feel sick to know when we\\'re intimate she\\'s probably getting off thinking about that dynamic. I feel depressed when I\\'m around her now, and I can\\'t help but see her differently than I always have. I know that in my heart I won\\'t ever be able to forget what she said. I just don\\'t feel secure in the relationship anymore.\\n\\nSo I\\'m considering ending it. Told her that I wasn\\'t comfortable anymore and that the knowledge she not only wants to open our relationship but reduce me to the role of a secondary sexual partner humiliated me and that I need time to think. I\\'m currently staying with a friend until I decide how to proceed.\\n\\nI know she\\'s not the asshole for having a kink, but am I the asshole for no longer wanting this relationship?',\n",

The longer we wait the harder it gets and I just want to tell him too bad, and end the pregnancy, but I dont want to hurt him or our marriage and he just wont listen...\\n\\n\\nEdit: Thank you for everyones kind words. We are still talking it through, but many points were brought to light that we hadnt even thought of in our grief, so we are getting closer to an agreement. I appreciate everyone who reached out to me and shared their own personal experiences.\\n\\nTo the people who are telling me to \"put my faith in God\" and \"I need to have hope, maybe he will survive\". Honestly, please look up any Patau syndrome cases before you urge someone to have false hope. We\\'re inbetween saying goodbye in person later after his death or saying goodbye and letting him go now. Obviously our situation isnt looking good or we wouldnt be considering it in the first place',\n",
       " 'So this happened about 6 months ago and isn\\'t a huge deal anymore, but it occasionally comes up and i think about it from time to time wondering if i really am an a-hole for it.  Story goes that it was my gf\\'s birthday so i went over to her house so we could celebrate.  As soon as i walked into her room i noticed an opened condom wrapper on the floor.  It couldn\\'t have been one from me because we had never had sex at that point.  I showed it to her and asked why it was there.  She, of course, denied cheating on me and said it probably was an old one that came from under her bed (she has a cat that could have found it and started to play with it).\\n\\nI wasnt completely convinced and knew i needed to check the trash to be sure there wasnt a condom in there.  She left the room to go do something so i decided i would check.  She was using a plastic bag hung up on her closet door as a trash bag.  So i looked inside and, without having to dig through any trash, i saw a used condom in it.\\n\\nI was beyond pissed, absolutely sure that she had cheated on me.  I grabbed the condom (a bit gross i know but i was angry and didn\\'t really care) and went downstairs to confront her with it.  She lives at her grandmothers house, along with her sister and her sisters bf.  Her sisters bf ended up coming up the stairs as i was going down and saw the condom i was holding.  He was unsurprisingly confused as to why i was holding a condom and asked who\\'s it was, so i told him \"well it isn\\'t mine\".  He got that \"oh shit\" look on his face and went upstairs.  I caught up with my gf and showed her the condom and we ended up going back upstairs to argue about it.\\n\\nShe was mad at me for going through her trash, saying it was a breach of her privacy.  I was mad because i had just found a used condom wrapper on her floor and a used condom in her trash.  She continued denying that she cheated on me and said that it was an old bag that she found in her closet that she decided to use for trash, and that she must have thrown that condom in there as trash the last time she had sex.  I didn\\'t believe her as the chances of finding a used wrapper and condom was too small for me to think it was just coincidence.  Eventually her sister came up and helped us talk through it, telling me that she believed my gf was telling the truth and could tell when she was lying.  So i decided id listen to her and trust in my gf.  But my gf was still mad that i didn\\'t trust her immediately, had went through her trash, and embarrassed her by \\'showing\\' the condom to \\'everyone\\', on her birthday nonetheless.\\n\\nWe moved on from it, as we\\'re still together, but i still wonder if i was an a-hole for what i did or if it was appropriate that i believed she had cheated on me.  My gf has also done some other shitty things that still make me unsure sometimes whether i ever should have believed her or trust her now.\\n\\nINFO:  Let me give some info on why I\\'m not 100% sure that she cheated on me, even if i thought she had.  She was quite depressed, as well as having some things happen to her in the past, which resulted in her having a very low libido.  We weren\\'t having sex at this point because of it, which makes me wonder why she would cheat on me with someone else if she wouldn\\'t have sex with me.  I\\'m not positive that she didn\\'t of course, but i want to believe that didn\\'t until i have solid proof that she has cheated.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Well you guys were right.  I just logged into her Facebook account and looked at her messages.  It would seem she\\'s been fucking other guys and possibly some girls behind my back.  I feel completely idiotic for not trusting my gut long ago.   Needless to say i broke up with her this time.\\n\\nUPDATE:  I finished talking to her and she continues to deny that she cheated.  She did admit that she was talking to other guys and trying to have sex with them, but didn\\'t say she did have sex and that what she did isn\\'t cheating.  Unfortunately she\\'s an even bigger, heartless bitch than I would have thought because she is threatening to go to her lawyer and having me arrested for 1. \"Hacking\" into her social media, and 2. For going to her house and retrieving my computer which was intended to be a gift for her, before I knew she was a cheating bitch. I\\'m calling her on her bluff though and going to just try to move on with my life.  I blocked her and hopefully won\\'t hear from her, her lawyer, or the police anytime soon.  I do have screenshots of our chat though if you guys would like to read through our conversation.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Well here you guys go, this is most of the conversations that occurred between us.  Names and photos have been censored.  \\nhttps://imgur.com/a/8g7kLbD',\n",
       " \"This happened monday, fresh off the weekend and its been annoying me ever since. I am being treated like im in the wrong in this situation so lets see what you guys think.\\n\\nI drive a 2018 Range Rover with plenty of interior space. As such I keep three guns in my vehicle at all times. I keep a Glock 19 in my glove box, a .38 snubnose in my drivers side door, and a brand new V3 Tac 13 shotgun under the back seat.\\n\\nI also keep some other weapons and gear under the seats and in the side doors and trunk. I keep these for my own reasons and never bring them inside my office. I live in a metropolitan environment that is not friendly to weapons.\\n\\nTwo workers who I am on good terms with ask me if I would eat lunch with them. I agree. As we're leaving my coworker says he parked on the roof of our parking garage (he arrives late constantly and is unable to park in a desirable spot. This angers me to say the VERY least as he invited me).\\n\\nThey suggest using my Range Rover as it has generous amounts of leg room even with my equipment and is just a nicer vehicle in general.\\n\\nI agree. One coworker sits in my front passenger seat, the other sits in the back. My coworker compliments my car which I enjoy. However he is very touchy and opens my glove box, revealing my glock 19 as well as my knife, and documents which spill on the floor. I slam the glove box closed and tell him not to touch things in my vehicle.\\n\\nThe ride is mostly silent, until i see my other coworker in the back seat nudge my concealed shotgun with his foot. He also turns his head and looks in my truck and starts asking me about my gear. I keep my camera and emergency roadside tool kit in there, along with some other less than lethal equipment.\\n\\nHe starts asking me about them and i give him the silent treatment for a few minutes before telling him to not look into my trunk.\\n\\nLunch was terrible. Overpriced and they couldnt cook a steak properly. As a gesture of good will i pay for said lunch.\\n\\nLater i was asked by my boss if i am bringing weapons into the workplace, which im not. They ratted me out. The parking garage is building property and all equipment, be it shotgun, revolver, or tazer is locked securely in my Range Rover.\\n\\nI feel like my privacy was invaded, and that i am not in the wrong here despite being brought aside by my boss. Am i the asshole?\",\n",
       " \"a few things to know before we start this: firstly, it's important to know that my girlfriend has been abused before in a past relationship, which was a few years ago. second, we have had sex before, but pretty rarely (she has never complained before afterwards). third, we've known each other for almost 10 years. lastly, i'm female, her abuser was male.\\n\\nmy girlfriend isn't asexual, but sex repulsed at times because of past abuse. and i'm ok with just cuddling and kissing, that's totally fine by me. i would never force her into anything she didn't want.\\n\\nthe other day she practically jumped on me, started touching me etc etc. we did it, showered together, cuddled, all that jazz. it is important to note that i asked her repeatedly throughout if she was okay with what i was doing, if she felt alright and stuff like that.\\n\\na few hours later however (she'd gone home afterwards), she calls me up and starts shouting at me why i had let her do that, when i knew she felt uncomfortable with sex, and that i should've known she was triggering herself purposefully by sleeping with me. i got mad at her and told her i had no way of knowing what she was thinking. i had asked her multiple times if she was alright, to which she had said yes, as i have mentioned before. had she said 'no' at any point, i would have stopped immediately.\\n\\nso, am i the asshole?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT:  so, here's an update for those who care:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nwhen i spoke to her again after about a week, she surprisingly still stuck with her argument that 'i should have known'. i did not expect this. i thought she would have snapped out of it by now. she did say she was being harsh when she called me on the phone and blamed me for everything, and she apologised for it, but she also said at the core she thinks she's in the right.\\n\\nneedless to say, that's a pretty big dealbreaker. we've all established that her actions were not okay, and she was wrong. very wrong, in fact.\\n\\nwe argued for a bit and then decided it would be for the best to take a break.\\n\\ni'm dissapointed in her, honestly. i thought she was smarter than this. i don't know what kind of bubble she's in, but if she's going to stay there, our relationship is over. i did everything i could have possible done to ensure her comfort, but it's not enough for her, apparently.\\n\\ni will do whatever i have to to take care of myself, my own problems, before i play anybody elses therapist.\\n\\nthanks everyone for the support.\",\n",
       " 'My husband got home while I was making dinner.  Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn‚Äôt hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said ‚Äúoh do you mind changing her diaper?‚Äù.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \\nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn‚Äôt have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn‚Äôt yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn‚Äôt want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \\nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \\nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was ‚Äúcovered in pee‚Äù because her clothes were wet).  \\n\\nAm I the asshole here?  \\n\\nEdit*. I walked away for a while because you know... kids.  And I am blown away by the amount of comments.  Yes,  I realize to a point that this isn‚Äôt normal behavior.  This is fairly new for my husband (the last year and a half or so).  He has sort of been diagnosed with OCD and this has been my life for a while with it.  Sometimes I lack perspective.  When she was a newborn he was changing her diaper and she explosively pooped (like across the room all over him type pooping) and he laughed about it.  That was before.  So I know a lot of people have certain ideas about him, but this isn‚Äôt the man I married.  He used to be really helpful with these things, but now I change easily 98% of diapers.  I was really, really pissed this morning which led me to writing this.  But seriously having all of you comment put things into a better perspective.  \\n\\nI told him in no uncertain terms that he needs individual counseling and we need marriage counseling (I am already in counseling myself).\\n\\nEdit 2-  I wanted to add because some one was wondering if I left anything else out... and I thought I could add context.  We also have a dog who is 18 months and I am still working on house breaking.  She has an accident inside maybe once a week (it‚Äôs also very cold out and she is tiny so those don‚Äôt mix well).  Part of his pee issues have come from that.  He thinks the dog is my responsibility and I know a lot of his pent up anger comes from that.  I don‚Äôt know if that is relevant to this situation as I don‚Äôt think they are related.  He thought he found pee on the carpet earlier in the day (he was mad at me because I wouldn‚Äôt smell it to make sure and I told him I‚Äôd clean it up when I got a second - I knew it was not pee as one of the kids had walked through with wet shoes).',\n",
       " 'Hello r/aita. Throwaway for what I hope are obvious reasons. \\n\\nThis post is the product of years of family drama that basically all center around my brother. He was raised as the true \"golden child\" of the family, much to the detriment of my and my sister. We were a very upper middle class family and my brother was the center of the \"wrong crowd\" and his life is in absolute shambles. He is 24 now and if I had to guess, my parents have spent $500,000 on various colleges, rehab programs and facilities, actor\\'s workshops, investment schemes and on and on. It could be a little less, it could be a lot more. The heartbreak of seeing my brother fail time after time had to be a major factor in my dad having a heart attack and dying at 63 four years ago.\\n\\nMy brother showed back up in Chicago area last summer with a sob story about why he failed out of the last rehab my mom had paid for but this time he claimed he was \"voluntary\" homeless. My mom couldn\\'t handle this so without checking with my or my sister, mom concocted this plan that the three of our households would \"take turns\" hosting my brother so he wouldn\\'t have to be on the streets (my mom\\'s new boyfriend, who is a decent guy, can\\'t stand my brother and probably put his foot down to taking brother on full time). So when I was told about this and when my \"turn\" first came around I told my brother that in no uncertain terms that he could stay, but he had to come to work at my company, I had to be with him at all times and he had to pay his room and board through helping me with fix up our house.  He wanted no part of that and has chosen to be homeless during every two week period that he was supposed to come stay with me. I have not seen him since and since I know my mom and sister have not put a hard line on him, I know he is still using. \\n\\nWell as the national news will tell you, we are in a massive deep freeze and of course this coincides with my two weeks to keep him. He showed up at my house on Friday night when we started hearing just how cold it was supposed to get. I told him that he had four choices, he could avail himself of the services that the city was putting together and remain homeless, he could go back with my mom or sister, he could take me up on my offer to work and help around the house OR I would buy him a bus ticket to Florida to get out of the cold. \\n\\nWell I don\\'t think he caught the meaning of a one way bus ticket. What I know he thought was happening is that I was giving him a ticket to go party on the beach until the cold passed and then I would provide for him to come home. When I dropped him off at the bus station earlier in the week he point blank asked me \"when and how will you send the return ticket?\"  I told him there was no return ticket, take what I was giving him or stay in the cold.  He proceeded then to unleash an angry cursed filled rant accusing me of every family sin under the sun until I kicked him out of my car. I know he got on the bus, beyond that I have no idea what happened to him and I care even less. \\n\\nedit: he absolutely knew I was giving him a one way ticket. Sorry for the confusion. He just thought this was an open ended party in Florida and I would be sending him a return ticket when he was ready to come home. There was no illusion or subterfuge on my part about the ticket. \\n\\n\\nMy mom is outraged at me, to the point where she is talking about suing me for \"great bodily harm\" (whatever that is supposed to mean), cutting me out of her will and estate and even telling my wife she\\'ll introduce her to divorce attorneys. My sister has quietly thanked me because she wasn\\'t sure how she was going to break it to my mom that she wasn\\'t taking my brother in anymore because her fianc√© was sick of him. \\n\\n\\nSo from the view of my mom, I am not only an asshole, I have apparently put my brother\\'s life in danger. \\n\\n\\nFrom me and my sister\\'s view I have washed our hand\\'s of a long standing problem, at least for a little while. \\n\\n\\nSo, am I the asshole?\\n\\n\\nedit2: wow this is easily my biggest post ever, by a large margin. I have about 410 unread posts as of this morning. I very much will try to read all of them. \\n\\nThere\\'s one thing I just want to address really quickly. People are saying \"YTA\" because I blame my dad\\'s heart attack on my brother. Surely you can say that my dad may have had a heart attack sooner or later but he died at 63 years old. Other men on his side of the family have lived well into their 80s and 90s (my Dad\\'s dad is still alive as an example, my two greatgrandfathers lived to 98 and 102 as another example). There is no doubt in my mind that stress of having to deal with my brother absolutely contributed to his poor health. I am no doctor but the links between stress and heart trouble are pretty well established and it got so bad at the end that my dad\\'s own cardiologist  was advising him that he had to let my brother go or it would kill him. My dad died after a series of small heart attacks and \"big one\" that started occurring after he went to somewhere in New Mexico and rescued my brother who was prostituting himself for meth and heroin, all while my parents were sending him something like $3500 a month for living expenses to get himself \"back on track.\" To me the link is so absolute that I feel 100% justified in blaming my brother for my dad\\'s death. You can judge me all you like but the pictures of how my dad changed from a robust man in his late 30s when my brother was born to a broken shell by the time he died would maybe change your judgement.

If you dont meet your deadlines, we\\'re gonna have a discussion about why that didnt happen. If I see you bullying a coworker, I will shut it down publicly. If I see you putting your work onto others, I will directly ask you why you deserve to be paid. I wont ask anybody to do something i wouldnt do.\\n\\nI have fired three people in the three years our business has been running, and im not afraid to fire more if needed. I care very much about my company and I dont let anything slide.\\n\\nSo, now that that has been established. Last week I was involved in a car wreck on my way to work. BMW ran a red and T-boned my sedan on the passenger side. I spun out, bashed into an electric pole. I was lucky I wasnt hit on my drivers side as this car was going fast.\\n\\nSmashed my face on my steering wheel and door. Busted my nose pretty good. Two black eyes now. Pieces of glass cut up my face and my leg, and my lip got busted. Also, the worst injury, I broke my wrist and hand which is currently in a cast.\\n\\nBMW driver was fine. Car ended up getting towed and the EMTs bandaged my nose and plugged my nostrils to stop the bleeding. At the time I told them my wrist was fine, just sprained. Took it to a doctor over the weekend and yep, its broke.\\n\\nSedan was totalled and had to be towed.\\n\\nAt this point I had two options. I could either go home and rest, take a day off, or go into work.\\n\\nIn the past ive given many pep talks about being committed to your job, to overcoming obstacles, to making sacrifices and taking risks. I have denied sick days in the past for various reasons that werent satisfactory. \\n\\nSo, I decided to use this as a teaching moment and prove that im not all talk. I call a lyft, and show up to work. I looked like I was just mugged, but i showed. People bombarded me with questions and asked if i needed an ambulance but i just explained what happened and that everything is fine.\\n\\nI went to my office and got to work. One of the other owners came into my office and asked if I was alright. I said I was but he said I should go home or to the hospital. I had already paid to be brought here so I refused. He tried to insist but I wouldn\\'t back down. I worked the rest of the week.\\n\\nThis week me and the other owners had a lengthy discussion about it and while they understand my reasoning they dont like that i came in and that i refused to leave. Its not a huge deal but what do you guys think?\\n\\nEDIT: Alright, well I was willing to keep going with this as its pretty interesting but theres been a lot of unrelated falsehoods. \\n\\nFor instance this thread is about me showing up to work injured. Not whether you think im a terrible manager.\\n\\nAlso theres a lot of lies. People saying things like \"You obviously only hire desperate people\" when we hire college grads who start off making amazing salaries and get 30 applicants per position.\\n\\nIm actually fine with correcting these lies as, who cares? Its just more info and idc about downvotes.\\n\\nHowever a mod just informed me that its against the rules to correct said lies. Pretty stupid rule, or a pretty stupid interpretation of a rule by a pretty angry internet moderator.\\n\\n Im not going to stay here and not be able to correct observably false things.

       " 'Some back story. I\\'m white, my best friend since middle school is a black dude named Rob. I\\'m not a white guy who says \"I have lots of black friends\" because I don\\'t, but Rob and I have been thick as thieves since we went to Jr nationals for wrestling. I literally love the guy like a brother.\\n\\nWe are in second semester of freshman year at our state university. Since we both hope to apply to professional grad schools, we\\'ve been searching around for community service groups in order to make contacts, get experience and maybe even help the community. We both volunteered for a veterans service organization where we go around and make sure that elderly veterans have thier basic services covered and aren\\'t living in a dirty house. So far it\\'s been kind of a waste of time because everyone we check has thier shit together and seem to resent us as busy bodies. Whatever, the leader of this group thinks she\\'s saving the world and Rob and I are gong to stick it out to spring break and then find something else.\\n\\nSo the group had this dinner on Wednesday night at a restaurant and we went because, why not free food. I have no idea what Robs deal was but I looked across the table and Rob was cutting and eating his hamburger with a knife and fork. I about died laughing because it looked so ridiculous and I had no idea what he was doing and I\\'ve eaten meals with him thousands of times and I\\'ve never seen him do such a thing. It was hysterically funny.\\n\\nSo I looked at him and I said \"hey Rob are you eating your burger with a fork because you don\\'t like black people touching your food?\"  Rob literally laughed so hard that he coughed up the piece in had in his mouth. We say stuff like this to each other all the time. \\n\\nBut the reaction from everyone else was the most ridiculous \"clutch the pearls\" shocked white people reaction you\\'ve ever seen. I may as well have shot Rob in the face. I was scolded by the head of of the volunteer group in person, while literally every other person present came over to Rob to make sure he was \"OK.\"  I knew I fucked up but as we were leaving we got a huge laugh about it and Rob told me that some of the cuter volunteer chicks might actually feel sorry for him enough to have sex with him. I thought it was over and done with.\\n\\nWell yesterday director lady sent out a group email talking about the \"horrors of racism\" and how words have power and how racism must be ripped out by its roots wherever we see it and at the end she said \"u/Monsterof will be apologizing to the entire group at Friday\\'s meeting.\" Not apologizing to Rob who my joke was directed towards...but apparently to the group of angry white peoples who were sleepless over the mean words (not directed at them) I said to my best friend ok the planet.\\n\\nAgain, Rob and I got a big laugh but I\\'m really pissed she said I WOULD be apologizing when I hadn\\'t even been consulted yet. I think I should just quit and leave her hanging. Rob wants me to get up there and make a mockery of her apology but I don\\'t even want to do that. \\n\\nNot necessarily looking for advice because I have until 3 when the meeting starts, but am looking for am I the asshole or not?\\n\\n\\nEdit: well group meeting came and went. They didn\\'t want to allow Rob into the meeting to hear the apology lest he have to hear the offending words again or some such absolute horseshit, Rob\\'s a pretty chill dude but I think that really bothered him. We didn\\'t make a huge scene like I guess we could of, we both basically said \"no thank you\" and we\\'ll take our services elsewhere. Rob says hello...',\n",

It bothered me a bit, partly because she is 19 and I am 36, but once again, I trusted him, so I left it alone.  \\n\\nOccasionally when he was texting her I would ask what they were talking about, and he gave me vague answers.  \\n\\nOne day I came home and found him talking on the phone with her.  This bothered me.  When he got off the phone I told him how much it bothered me.  I asked to see the messages between the two of them.   He said that they were private.  \\n\\nHe mentioned that the two of them had played a game where they guessed secrets about each other, and he gave his word not to show it to anyone.

       " 'This situation happened a few days ago, but its spreading rapidly through my friend groups and social media, and I\\'m kind of at a loss as what to do or if I\\'m actually an asshole for the way I handled it.\\n\\nSituation starts with me (20M) and my trans friend, let\\'s call her (19 MtF pre-op) Kat. Now Kat and I have been good friends since high school, and since we\\'re sophomores in college now that\\'s roughly 6+ years of friendship. She\\'s a part of my group of closest friends, and while I don\\'t consider myself as close to her as I do some of the others and rarely hung out alone with her, we were still fairly close. \\n\\nFast forward to a few days ago, and Kat and a few other friends are hanging out at my apartment, drinking, playing Smash, and having a good time. Hours pass and friends have to leave, but Kat noticeably isn\\'t leaving. Now this is usually fine, I\\'m okay with having friends sleep over if they just don\\'t feel like heading home, but Kat kept insinuating they didn\\'t want to just sleep (with forced jokes like \"But I want to still *Smash*\" or \"*We should Smash more*\" while rubbing against me.) \\n\\nAdmittedly a little drunk but picking up on the obvious cues, I bluntly said \"Fuck no, I\\'m going to sleep.\" Kat responds, \"So you\\'ll fuck X but you won\\'t give me a chance?\" (X being a former fwb of mine in the group, and it being known that we were active for a while) and then she drops the million dollar question, \"Is it because I\\'m trans?\"\\n\\nOf course the drunk idiot I am said, \"Honestly?....Yeah dude.\", thinking to myself that since she\\'s pre-op it...wouldn\\'t work out in a way I\\'d be comfortable with. Not necessarily an issue with her being transgender, more so with her parts in intimacy. Also now that I\\'m sober I\\'m sure I would\\'ve said no regardless, as even though she passes very well and is on hormones, it would still be very weird to me since I knew her before transitioning, and wouldn\\'t be able to not think of the male Kat.\\n\\nAnyway, Kat hears this, tears up (attributing this to being drunk and getting rejected) packs up her things, calls an uber and storms out. At this point I was drunk, tired and really just wanted to get some sleep. I wake up Sunday morning to my phone absolutely loaded with messages from friends, Kat\\'s brother, Kat\\'s sister, etc. She relayed what happened last night and now my friends are divided on how to feel. Some say I had the right to say no, others are saying my reasons for saying no are the issue. I already tried texting Kat my explanation (not just being trans, pre-op, wouldn\\'t be comfortable, etc. etc.) but it seems I\\'m blocked on almost everything, and news is spreading fast.

       " 'I recently had a one night stand with this girl and I was wondering if I was asshole in this situation.\\n\\nShe started off by giving me a blow job (with condom on), I *think* she just meant it as foreplay rather than me ejaculating. But after 15 minutes I did. Afterwards she asked me to give her oral in return, I said I can‚Äôt because I have no protection for oral sex. **I offered to do hand stuff to her or if she was willing to wait 30minutes we can have sex.** She said it unfair because I had an orgasm and she didn‚Äôt. She got angry with me and started calling me derogatory terms and threated to tell all her friends that I am pussy and is bad at bed \\\\[we didn‚Äôt have sex\\\\]. I felt a little uncomfortable and left.\\n\\nI know I was selfish in not reciprocating oral sex, but I personally feel that her reaction was a bit too much.\\n\\nEdit: I think there is some misconception going on. Usually on a one-night stand that I been on, I would use my hand at the start and then we will procced to have sex. There will be no oral from any parties.\\n\\nIn this instance she took control of the situation and went for a blow job without me saying anything. My plan in the moment was to let her give me a blow job, go back to kissing, I use my hands to make her climax, more kissing and then we go to sex. I never made any promise of giving oral and never planned to. The only person I gave oral to was ex-girlfriend who I knew didn‚Äôt have any STI and i felt comfortable with. **I have never heard of ‚Äòdental dam‚Äô or any protection for oral sex.**',\n",
       " 'Ok, so I\\'m going to paint the picture. It\\'s been frigid and unbearable outside the past few days and has given myself and dog a case of cabin fever. He\\'s use to having a hour walk on the beach and a few small walks each day. So after 3 days of just small walks and being stuck in the house I wanted to let him stretch his legs. He\\'s a 60 pound German Shorthaired Pointer and loves running.\\n\\nNow my closest dog park is about a 40 minute ride and I usually don\\'t go too often because it\\'s so far out of the way for me. Keep in mind it\\'s a county run dog park and is only ever closed for maintenance or for use of the county.\\n\\nWhen I arrived I was excited to see a good amount of cars, sometimes it\\'s hit or miss and you can find yourself there with just 1-2 other dogs. \\n\\n I walked up to the entrance to the enclosed dog park (which is blocked by trees from the parking lot) and saw the park was loaded with Labradoodles. It was pretty awesome and funny to see about 20-25 Labradoodles in one place.\\n\\nBefore I even open up the gate to go in I\\'m told to stop by a dog owner, I do so because I didn\\'t know if there was a nasty dog in the park. This lady goes on to tell me that the park is closed for an event hosted by the ________ County Labradoodle Association. She tells me that I can go to the small dog area down the road (which is roughly the size of two mobile homes, not the 3 acre park I\\'m at now). \\n\\nI\\'m not one for conflict so I kinda laugh and say no thank you (laughing is just a reaction I have when I\\'m confronted, more of a chuckle). I go to open up the gate and she sticks her foot in the way so I can\\'t open it. She tells me to stop laughing in her face and to go to the small dog area (with my 60 pound dog?). At this point in the conversation we started to get an audience, knowing people were watching she started to get louder and tell me to leave. \\n\\nI was relieved when another person came over but it turned out to be her husband. He tried telling me they\\'ve been organizing this meet up for the past 3 months and put a lot of effort into getting a good turn out. He was trying to be reasonable but I really just couldn\\'t see it for their perspective. \\n\\nNow this whole time my dog is whining and crying trying to get into the park and other dogs have gathered and are barking at the new comer. The lady flips this on me, and says that im causing an unnecessary scene. A few other owners come along and tell her to let me in. She graciously gives me 10 minutes of time in the park.\\n\\nMy dog is happier than a pig in sh*t, running around and having a ball. All the time he\\'s under the close supervision of this woman, Rachel and her husband. \\n\\nNow this is where I may become the a**hole,\\napparently she set a timer and proceeds to tell me my time is up. Without even thinking and completely on impulse like a crime of passion I say  \"F*** off you annoying C***.\" That\\'s right, I said the no-no word. The one you\\'re never to call a woman.\\n\\nI froze and just decided to own it. I walked away and told her to leave me alone. Her husband was not too impressed with what I had to say and came to confront me. Now, they may be older than me (mid 40\\'s) but I\\'m 27 and sure as hell not a kid.\\n\\nHe goes on to insist I apologise to his wife and that I need to conduct myself like an adult and not a frat boy. He tells me to do so or face the consequences for my actions, I ask him if he\\'s threatening me, he tells me your damn right I am. I agree to apologise to her. I get my dog and leave without saying a word to her. \\n\\nI sit in my car and a call the park rangers and tell them the whole situation, they tell me they received two other calls about the incident, previous people getting turned away. So about 20 minutes later 4 trucks of park rangers show up and shut down the park for unscheduled maintenance for about an hour. \\n\\nReally not the outcome I wanted because because it seemed to only be the one couple and about 4 other people in their posse. I felt like shit because about 15 other people had their outting ruined. So I\\'m just sitting here in my car waiting for the park to reopen while the rangers do \"maintenance\" and I\\'m wondering AITA? \\n\\nTLDR- Denied entry to dog park, allowed to come in for 10 minutes, told to leave, drop the C-bomb, leave and get the park closed for \"maintenance\"\\n \\n',\n",
       " 'Just had a fight with my SO because of what I told our daughter about \"legit violence\". Going to roll the story out as short as possible.\\n\\nSo there\\'s this kid in my daughters day care. He\\'s the same age but often shows some strange behaviour. Overall he\\'s a cool little brat and I actually like him for being somewhat rebellious, mostly because I think his parents are crazy helicopter parents. Anyway. My daughter told me that this kids greets her every day way \"too hard\" e.g. hugging her uncomfortably long and forceful. Sometimes he kisses her in this situation. She says that sometimes she laughs it off and thinks it\\'s funny but sometimes she really doesn\\'t want it and he won\\'t stop even if she yells at him. I saw those \"greetings\" some times and know what she means. \\n\\nShe already told the teachers but they barely see it happen and the other kid won\\'t stop it even after being told by the adults. \\n\\nSo basically I told my daughter that it\\'s totally okay to push someone away in such a situation. I said if someone hurts her and won\\'t stop even when she screams at him to do so, when the other kid forces kisses upon her and so on, it\\'s absolutely fine to push him away. \\n\\nI watched her thinking for a few seconds, then she replied \"but he might push back or beat me if I do this\". I simply told her \"then you push him back again and/or run away and tell an adult\".\\n\\nMy SO overhears our conversation and told me I\\'d be wrong here. That it\\'s always better to tell the teachers and not use violence at all. I said I didn\\'t tell our daughter to beat random kids up (and we are very straight in raising our daughter concerning violence to other kids) but to use legit force in a situation where someone violently forces himself on her. I think our daughter is old and clever enough to recognize the difference.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\n__________________\\n**Edit:** Holy crap, this exploded. Thanks for the gold! I didn\\'t expect to get so much feedback and thank everyone who participated in the still ongoing discussions.\\n\\nI\\'ll add some details here. \\n\\n1. My daughter told me this whilst we played Legos. It was just some of those random kid stories that sometimes come out. This shows me it\\'s something that she thinks about. I don\\'t want her to develop a negative attitude towards her day care, so I considered this to be a small problem that could get bigger and therefore needed a solution.\\n\\n2. I don\\'t the other kid is a bully. His parents have a hard time as they also have a severely autistic older son that needs a lot of their time. And when they have time for him, they are overly careful. I also don\\'t think that his behavior is a sign of sexual abuse, but he might be emotionally troubled.\\n\\n3. I think that the daycare teachers do a good job but they don\\'t have all-seeing-eyes. \\n\\n4. I wish my daughter becomes a straight forward, self-conscious and secure person that always finds ways to voice or show things that make her uncomfortable. I\\'d like her to know that she can talk to me and my SO about everything, especially in her teen years. \\n\\n',\n",

Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn‚Äôt then I didn‚Äôt really want to continue things with her.

I joked about how I could have guessed that, and she goes on to talk about I really have no idea how much this turns her on. She told me that she literally dreams of him and me double teaming her.\\n\\nI was obviously disgusted and got pissed. I told her that she\\'s sick, she got offended and said that she trusts me and that if I really love her, I should stand by her no matter how weird her fantasies are. I asked her if he ever molested her, and she said that she can\\'t believe me, grabbed her keys, and left.\\n\\nI ended up calling her sister to ask if anything to that nature ever went on in their house, and she immediately guessed what had happened.

       " \"M(49)  military veteran reared in the south asked my spouse F(35) reared in upstate NY her thoughts on the recent ruling that girls could participate in the boy scouts.  For clarification purposes,  she was in the girl scouts.  I was not in the boy scouts. I tried to explain to her last night after hearing the news of girls being allowed in the boy scouts that I no longer feel comfortable encouraging our young son to participate in the boy scouts now that girls are allowed in the boy scouts. It seems like common sense to me. Girls go in the girl scouts,  boys go in the boy scouts... hence the name GIRL scouts and BOY scouts.  Her explanation was that she quit the girl scouts because they didn't do cool stuff like the boy scouts and she feels as if girls should be allowed into the boy scouts.  I explained to her that the coolness factor she spoke of was merely her perception as a bit of a tomboy as a youngster. In addition, while yes it is pretty cool to become an eagle scout, this coolness factor needed to be addressed in the higher management of the girl scouts and not just solved by blurring lines and pushing the girls that want to do cooler stuff  into an organization that is already taxed by other recent changes and guidelines that are due to affect boy scout membership in a not so positive light. She assures me that my thinking is outdated and antiquated and that boys these days don't care if girls are in the girl scouts. I, on the other hand,  view it as a matter of principle. I love my spouse dearly and am trying hard to understand her point of view simply because we she be a united front, but I just am having an extremely difficult time getting past this very basic premise. I would truly appreciate views from males and females of all ages with or without  experience in the girl and boys scouts and will take all opinions under advisement, because as of the time of this posting, I'm still salty about our difference of opinion. I'm feeling like a bit of a fossil over here. \",\n",

I order water and she orders a cocktail. Before the food even arrived she has finished her 3rd cocktail and just ordered a 4th. I make a joke something to the effect of \"usually it only takes 2 cocktails before I start looking attractive \". She laughs and says no I just don\\'t get a chance to go out and be treated by someone else often.

The drinks didnt appear particularly strong, typical overpriced fruity drinks. \\n\\nAnyway, the waitress places the check and I let it sit there for a minute to see if she attempts to reach for it, she doesnt.

She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \\n\\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That‚Äôs when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me.

My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\\n\\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we‚Äôd mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we‚Äôd stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we‚Äôd be together. \\n\\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn‚Äôt that big of a deal because it‚Äôs happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \\n\\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there‚Äôs more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory‚Äôs. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn‚Äôt mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn‚Äôt planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn‚Äôt hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there‚Äôs no one else she‚Äôs ever ask. \\n\\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn‚Äôt mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn‚Äôt be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I literally cried all weekend. \\n\\nHere‚Äôs the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy‚Äôs brand of ‚Äúfirey‚Äù is a Much better match to Gregory‚Äôs calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it‚Äôs those two. I just can‚Äôt help being hurt. \\n\\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\\n\\n\\nedit: this blew up like crazy. I had no idea, thank you I think pretty much everyone so far thinks at least my initial reaction is ok. \\n\\nThe thing that people seem most confused by is the timeline and honestly I was wrong in my OP. Tam and I only talked for maybe 10 minutes on Friday evening so there is a lot I don\\'t know but I went through my texts and such and this is the best I can put together.\\n\\nJune 2017--Gregory took me to Hawaii, that is the last time I saw him. We texted maybe two three times a week. \\n\\nMay 2018--Tammy gets her job and moves to new city. We text or call easily a combined 100 times a day or more. \\n\\nlate July 2018-- Tammy confesses that she\\'s really lonely, all her coworkers are older and she\\'s seriously thinking about quitting and moving back. I tell her she should call Greg, she doesn\\'t have his number so I give it to her. I still keep getting \"flirty\" but nothing overt from Gregory in this time period\\n\\n\\nAugust 2018-- I start a project at my job (promotions company) setting up for a December event for a A/B list celebrity. It\\'s literally make or break for my company and my career. I work 16 hour day minimums and basically go off the grid. Greg still texts occasionally and I keep missing Tammy\\'s calls. \\n\\nSeptember 2018--last text from Greg, like I said no big deal. I didn\\'t even see this until today but Tammy texted me \"please call me ASAP, we really need to talk about something.\" This adds a whole new element to the story but I can\\'t believe I forgot or missed the text. I respond to another text of her\\'s later in the day kindy of bitchy \"hey you know I\\'m busy...give me some time to breathe.\" Another piece I forgot until I dug in my texts. She may have taken this as a message I wasn\\'t ready. \\nI assume this is when they first hooked up. \\n\\n\\nSeptember to December: we still miss each other and honestly don\\'t think I talked to her and looking back she texted about 5 times to every one of my responses and if I read it right, she initiated all conversations. I wasn\\'t a very good friend. My event goes off pretty well and then I immediately leave for an overseas vacation with my family. \\n\\n\\nJanuary. We still didn\\'t talk at all but I didn\\'t think much of it. \\n\\n\\nFriday the 1st.

       " 'I‚Äôm a freshman in high school, and my mom never let get my vaccines in grade 7, which caused me to be suspended in grade 7 and 8. This year, the kids who hadn‚Äôt gotten them were called down to get them, and I had missed 4 very important vaccines. I got them, and I was given a note to show my mom what I had gotten. When I told my mom, she got mad because I didn‚Äôt ask her, and she wasn‚Äôt given any heads up about it (she was given notice). She that it was wrong and awful that they did that because she said that the vaccines I got cause problems and diseases, which I obviously believed for a long time as I was raised to believe that, but now being older I can see how messed up that is. She went on about how she was going sue my school for giving me vaccines and she was calling the cops. When I got home she yelled at me for having them done. I calmly tried to tell her they were important to my health, which prompted her to take my phone and say I‚Äôm not allowed to make that decision for her.

Its not quite as fast as I want it but it looks amazing and the sound system is seriously as good as it can be.\\n\\nI live in a large apartment complex in Tucson, I'm guessing probably 100 units or so. Not sure. Anyways the complex is really cool because a lot of places won't let you work on your car, well I can pay an extra premium every month to get a mechanics spot under shade. It's an extra 2 bills a month but so worth it. \\n\\nWhen I work on my car I BLAST my system. It helps me think and focus. Also important to note our complex has quiet hours between and 10pm and 8am, I follow these to the letter but I do need to work on my car so some Saturday's and Sunday's I crank shit from 8:01am to 9:59pm. I am not breaking any rules at all.\\n\\nI moved in in January and this Sunday was apparently a major problem. I had two people ask me to turn it down. I totally did but one came back and said its not the volume, it's the bass, can I turn the bass down. I said I would try but I guess that wasn't good enough because he came down a third time. Finally I told him I paid for the spot, I wasn't breaking any rules, I'd only be out there until 10pm. He said his kids had to go to bed at 8:30 and the bass from my car was rattling his walls. I told him I'd done my best to accommodate him but I was done. He told me he'd call the police (who never showed) and talk to management. I just stopped responding to him and cranked my system to drown our his barking. I worked on my car until 9:59 when I turned my system off.\\n\\nI got an email from my apartment manager asking if she could come by. She's really cool and I want to help her but I feel like I'm paying extra for the mechanics spot, I'm not breaking any rules and that guy had no right to talk to me like that. She said she managed a nice place and she's gotten complaint after complaint about my car. I told her I was sorry but I was still well within my rights and not breaking rules. She asked me to please consider for her sake using headphones Or earbuds if music is that important to me. I said I'd try,\\n\\nI worked on my car all night last night and used ear buds and it just wasn't the same. I spent thousands of dollars and so much time to tune my system perfectly and to not use it when I want sucks. I want to help her out but am I even being an asshole in the first place?\",\n",
       " 'My boyfriend and I planned a group trip skiing out west with some of his friends and some of mine.  We got a big house and he and I got our own room to share there.  Everyone else was sharing beds also.  \\n\\nIt was a very social trip - we all cooked dinner together every night and played games.  It was so fun for me because I live alone and have a very small family so even on holidays I don‚Äôt get to have big dinners and fun.  We also have small apartments in my city at home so no one has big gatherings.   We split up during the day to ski and I was mostly skiing alone there because I‚Äôm only an advance beginner while many of them are either experts or didn‚Äôt ski.  I didn‚Äôt even go to the same mountain as the three guys except Saturday and we only skiied together for two hours.  That was fine but I liked being with everyone at night.\\n\\nThe last night was Monday night and we all stayed up till 1;30am except my boyfriend.  He was falling asleep in bed at 10 so I snuggled him to sleep and then went back downstairs to hang out.  He got back up around 12:15 and hung out for another half hour and then went back to sleep.  I had asked him at least three times that day if he packed yet.  I packed at 6pm because I wanted to sleep in and knew I‚Äôd be up late.\\n\\nAnyway all seemed fine until the next morning when I woke up at 6:30 to use the bathroom, came back to bed and he got up because check out was at 10 and the boys were skiing that day so had to be packed and out the door by 8am.  \\n\\nI went back to sleep but he then turned on all the lights, made the bed with me in it and told me to move to the other side of the bed so he could pack.  He said I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep through him packing.  I put on my noise canceling headphones covered my eyes and attempted to sleep but I could sense he was furious at me and he kept banging his clothes on the bed and even put something on my leg.  \\n\\nI looked at him and he said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt say anything - I don‚Äôt want my head bitten off and fight on our last day.‚Äù  He looked so mad.  I hadn‚Äôt said anything except muttering about everyone having gone to bed very late.  He banged around then finally left and didn‚Äôt say goodbye even though I was flying that day and he and his friend were staying at a hotel and not leaving till the next day.\\n\\nLater I texted ‚Äú no goodbye?‚Äù And he wrote back ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to disturb you and get my head bitten off.‚Äù  I tried to figure out what he was talking about but he blocked me. \\n\\nThen later I emailed and said I didn‚Äôt understand why he was mad and that I should be the one annoyed because he was so inconsiderate when packing.  We had a walk in closet basically a little room and he had plenty of room  in there to pack or he could have done it quietly.   But I didn‚Äôt complain just put on my headphones and ignored him so I had no idea why he was upset.\\n\\nThen he emailed a response:  \\n\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to tip toe during packing.   I have a mountain of stuff to keep together.  \\nI don‚Äôt need some person lounging in my space during that.   \\n\\nI just don‚Äôt like people that aren‚Äôt morning people.   It‚Äôs annoying.  \\n\\nAlternatively, how nice would the morning have been if you were up with coffee and sitting and speaking to me during this.   That‚Äôs what I like.  Quality time.  \\n\\nNot 2 ships passing in the wind doing their own things.‚Äù  \\n\\nI also had explained to him that I can get up early if I too go to bed early but this was not that sort of trip.\\n\\nAITA for wanting to get more than 5 hours of sleep but also participate in the entire group socializing?\\n\\nEdited:  spoke to him and he can‚Äôt seem to believe that I wasn‚Äôt mad at him that morning and he thinks he is totally in the right that I should get up when he was packing and sleeping on the other side wasn‚Äôt good enough.  He also thinks I chose hanging out with the group over him. ',\n",

The whole thing just felt really trashy.\\n\\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn\\'t want her spending the night with her anymore.

I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life.

When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother\\'s house. It\\'s not that I don\\'t trust my son, it\\'s because I strive to provide a safe environment. \\n\\nEdit: I\\'ve been reading some of the comments and I\\'m wondering how many of you actually have children. \\n\\nI\\'m disturbed by the way the friends family handled things, and I found it extremely inappropriate.

Week 12 comes along and the pregnancy is announced - I told my wife how happy I was to be able to talk about it with her having known for a little while, which is when the argument started.

To clarify a few things:\\n\\n- The scan (and the subsequent scan) went well, they have a healthy baby on the way!\\n- I don't think my friend was the asshole, he was excited and probably quite nervous pending the scan. I have children so the conversation was able to lead into questions/concerns shared. He's going to be a great Father.\\n- My wife can tend to tell her Mother and sisters secrets that they shouldn't/don't need to know. I don't think she would have let on about this, but my friend was probably worried she might.\\n- We have spoken about not keeping secrets before, and I do keep to that. We do however also agree that promises must be kept, I feel this was an acceptable secret to keep given the circumstances. The promise was made after being told, and asked to not tell.\",\n",
       " 'TLDR: Mature 16 year old daughter wants to date, I won‚Äôt allow it because as bad as it sounds, she‚Äôs a girl. \\n\\nI have a 16 year old daughter. She‚Äôs beautiful, does amazing in school, and is constantly  surprising me by how mature she is. \\nI often ask her for her opinion in family matters she probably shouldn‚Äôt know about, but she‚Äôs always levelheaded and  gives pretty good advice. She‚Äôs only ever slipped up twice. I‚Äôm a devoted Catholic, and when she was 12, she refused to go to church and told us she didn‚Äôt believe in God. This hurt me and my wife deeply and I‚Äôll admit, I yelled at her until she couldn‚Äôt talk anymore since she was crying. Not my proudest moment, but it happened. To this day she doesn‚Äôt believe in God, but the condition of her staying in our home is that she at least attend church with us. \\nThe second time she slipped up was when she was caught shoplifting. The cops let her go and there‚Äôs nothing on her record, and she said it was like an itch and she felt so terrible about it. I don‚Äôt let her walk around alone in stores anymore. In her defense, she‚Äôd been dealing with severe depression and mental health issues at that time. \\n\\nNow, the other day she comes to the living and sits down. She says she has something to talk to me about, and that she knew I wasn‚Äôt going to get mad. It looked like she was about to cry, but she said that she had met this boy who she‚Äôd liked for a year. Apparently, on New Year‚Äôs eve, he‚Äôd told her that he‚Äôd liked her for a long time and he really wanted to be her boyfriend. \\nShe said she wanted to let me know and that she really liked this boy. I generally am very strict, so my kids don‚Äôt go out much and aren‚Äôt allowed to date until I say so. Years ago, I said that the age when they could date was 16. She recalled this and said that she was 16 and she just wanted to get my permission first. \\n\\nI appreciate this, but I meant that my boys could date when they were 16. I love my daughter but she‚Äôs my only girl. I know she‚Äôs mature but women are easily manipulated and I just want her to be safe. I told her that I‚Äôm glad she asked, but it was a no until she graduated. I think she expected me to say yes, as her face dropped. She nodded but she‚Äôs the type to fight until the end to prove she‚Äôs right. \\nShe brings up how her brother dated at 16, and how I‚Äôd let her younger brother date at 14. \\nShe keeps this up until I am forced to say that it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs a girl. This clearly upsets her and she stands up to leave. But first she just says that she loves me but she‚Äôs disappointed. \\n\\nShe‚Äôs still upset but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that much of a problem. I‚Äôm not trying to be sexist, I‚Äôm just protective over my daughter. I know she‚Äôs smart and mature, but men can be dangerous, and I don‚Äôt want to put her through anything. \\n\\nEDIT: Okay, I knew I‚Äôd get a lot of ‚ÄúYTA‚Äù but that‚Äôs just how I was raised. It‚Äôs not that I think lowly of women, I just seriously don‚Äôt trust the boys out there. \\n2nd EDIT: We are a Hispanic Catholic family. I raised my kids to have faith. I respect her choice to not believe in God.\\n3rd EDIT: Yes, my wife gets a say, but I am the final decision maker. My wife most likely thinks the same as most commenters here, but like I said, I‚Äôm the man of the house.\\n4th EDIT: Another reason I don‚Äôt want her to date is that she can‚Äôt drive. She has her permit, but she says she‚Äôs very nervous about reversing and wants to get more practice. Even if she had her license and a car, I wouldn‚Äôt let her. But our town is small, so you can walk to all the ‚Äòhangout‚Äô places.\\n5th EDIT( I should stop): Okay, I get it. I understand that at 16, she should probably be allowed to date. But it‚Äôs my house, my rules. We have a loving relationship, so I doubt she‚Äôll just leave and never come back. ',\n",

When I expressed that to her, she kind of put her foot down and was like ‚Äúyeah, you can‚Äôt tell me what to wear, and I‚Äôm going to my best friend‚Äôs lingerie party‚Äù.

Never mentioned meeting up, and he lives 3 hours away. Take that for what its worth friends of the internet.\\n\\nEdit 3, months later: Turns out you were all right. She was projecting because she was keeping guys on the side. She never \"cheated\" in a strict definition of the word but she was talking to multiple guys. We are broken up and I am happily single.

       " 'I was at a large grocery store yesterday and I walked up to the butcher area to ask for assistance but there was one person ahead of me. When the person finished, I was just about to ask the butcher my question when a woman cut in front of me and asked him, \"Hi, can you please help me in the freezer aisle?\" The butcher said \"yes\" and was about to follow her when I interjected, \"Sir, I was here first.\" I swear I saw an eye roll on his part but whatever.\\n\\nMoving on. I had a cart full of groceries and I stood in line to check out. There was a woman who was unloading her packed cart in front of me so I waited a few feet behind her because had I moved my cart forward, I would have been blocking the traffic for other customers to walk through. Then, I see the same woman, who cut me off in the butcher station, nonchalantly walk in front of me and then she proceeded to unload her items onto the conveyor belt. I told her, \"Excuse me, ma\\'am, I\\'ve been waiting here. I\\'m next in line.\" She gave me a smug look and said, \"Ha, if you\\'re next, then why are you standing back there and not here??\" So I told her, \"Because I don\\'t want to block the flow of traffic walking by but I AM NEXT.\"\\n\\nGuys, she continued to argue with me saying, \"Well....you should\\'ve moved forward\" and then CONTINUED to unload her groceries. Keep in mind that I am not a confrontational person. In my 44 years on this planet, I have never been in a fist fight, In fact, I used to be a major pushover. If I was 18, I may have told her, \"You\\'re right, go ahead.\" Well, that\\'s not what happened.\\n\\nI. SAW. RED. I YELLED at her, \"Listen lady, I\\'m a civilized person who takes others into consideration, UNLIKE YOU who probably doesn\\'t give a shit would\\'ve blocked this entire area. Now put your things back into your cart NOW or I\\'m going to go over there and do it for you!\" Then, the kind lady that was originally in front of me, and had finally completed her transaction, took one look at her and said, \"Seriously? You need to move because she HAS been waiting.\" You\\'d think that she would have backed off? Nope. She continued to unload her groceries muttering that I should\\'ve been closer and not standing so far in the back.\\n\\nI yelled, \"I\\'m NOT going to tell you again. Get your shit and put it back into your basket or I\\'ll go and do it myself. NOW.\" She then took a good look at me and started putting her things back in her cart and walked away. I would imagine that by this point, my eyes were crossing and my head was two seconds from spinning like the kid from the Exorcist. I can\\'t remember the last time I\\'ve felt so angry.\\n\\nShe finally moved but she kept staring me down and I\\'m ashamed to tell you guys that I screamed \"WHAT THE F\\\\*\\\\*K ARE YOU LOOKING AT????????\" She finally looked away and as quick as this started, it ended. The nice lady that was in front of me patted me on my back and told me that she was impressed how I defended myself but to please calm down because I looked like I was about to pass out.\\n\\nI need to add that since the store was so packed and music was blaring, not many people witnessed what went down.  Only those within hearing range were able to witness this exchange.  I know....  No excuses.\\n\\nTo be honest, at this point in my life, I\\'ve let people walk all over me. If this had happened ten years ago, I would\\'ve let her go on ahead of me. Not now. I\\'m a jaded, middle aged woman who is not the one. Don\\'t get me wrong, what came out of me yesterday felt like an out of body experience. I\\'m not a mean person. She just sparked something in me that threw me over the edge.\\n\\nEdit: This may or may not be relevant, but I\\'m a Mexican American and all of this occurred in Spanish.

Believe me, if you guys knew how to speak Spanish, I would\\'ve written the exact exchange I had with this entitled twit in Spanish. I don\\'t know why but when arguments happen in Spanish, it looks like a much bigger deal!! ha!\\n\\nEDIT:  I\\'m getting some flack from some who are calling me an asshole because I assumed that there wasn\\'t a single person here that could speak or read in Spanish.

My daughter did not want to be in the play because she didn't want to be on stage. We talked about it with her teachers and she agreed to try it out. The teachers kept telling her that what was important was that she try her best.\\n\\nWell the play rolls around and the kids walk out on stage and my daughter take one look at the audience and starts crying. Just a couple tears at first but then a full out panic so my partner goes and pulls her off the stage. We sat in the audience and watched the play and she calmed right down.\\n\\nAfter the show, we tried to take her to the reception for the kids and parents and her teacher told us we have to leave because our daughter didn't make it through the show, so it wasn't fair for her to be at the after party. She told us we had to leave and actually took a cookie out of our daughters hand. It was a big scene so we left and took our daughter to Dairy Queen as a reward for trying it out.\\n\\nI would understand her being excluded if she had bailed, or thrown a tantrum and refused to get on stage, but she tried something new and I'm shocked that the school would respond in such a way to stage fright. I mean, she's 3 years old. What kind of lesson is that?\\n\\nI'm thinking we should pull her out and put her in the public preschool. She has friends from other activities in the public school so it's not as if we'd be ripping her away from all the people she knows. I just don't see the point in paying for a preschool that claims to endorse self esteem and then does that to my kid. My partner thinks I'm being rash. AITA?\",\n",
       " \"Yea, well this is kinda straightforward ish, and there are definitely parts where I am 100% an asshole. We have been dating almost 3 years at this point. I am 22 and she is 21.\\n\\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\\n\\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\\n\\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \\n\\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\\n\\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\\n\\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\\n\\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? \\n\\nEDIT: Another important detail... we have a trip coming up very soon. Which we probably can't cancel out of. I'm still going to go with my family, but my family is super protective and really don't want her to go anymore. She might be able to get out with her medical issues, but we aren't sure yet.\\n\\nEDIT2: Thanks everyone for you feedback. I'm definitely taking it all to heart. I broke up with her. My family is behind me and acting as a very good support network. I think I'm still in shock honestly. Hasn't really hit me yet that the girl I poured my heart and soul into for the past 3 years is a stranger now.\",\n",

       " 'A bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance\\'s mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn\\'t going to work anymore.\\n\\nNow to us, I\\'m 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\\n\\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\\n\\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\\n\\nI\\'m not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\\n\\nNow I\\'m not going to argue her Dad\\'s an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That\\'s the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\\n\\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won\\'t work now that she\\'s a wife. I get that it\\'s her mother\\'s kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I\\'m not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\\n\\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn\\'t be expected to do that unless I\\'m in a financial position to do so.\\n\\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married?

I‚Äôve tried a myriad of different diet plans and exercise routines over the years, but nothing seems to stick. My boyfriend and I both really want to have a big family, and I‚Äôve confided in him before that I can‚Äôt wait to have a baby, but the thought of being pregnant gives me a lot of anxiety because I don‚Äôt want to gain weight.\\n\\nSo last night he calls me out of the blue, and says he just wanted to say ‚ÄúI love you so much, and I can‚Äôt wait to marry you and have babies with you because you‚Äôll make such a wonderful mother...‚Äù and my heart is so full hearing this, and then he goes ‚Äú...but I can‚Äôt have you go and ballooning up each pregnancy. You‚Äôll be 300 pounds by the time we‚Äôre done having kids, and I‚Äôm not having sex with no big fat slob‚Äù and when I pushed back, he doubled down and set me guidelines of how much weight I am allowed to gain each pregnancy, and that after birth, I‚Äôll get one month to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù, then two months to get back to my pre-baby weight, and then I‚Äôll get pregnant again, and repeat.  \\n\\nSo we fought about it. I said he was being insensitive, and treating me like a sex-and-baby machine and not a human being. He tried to say he was only worried about my health (his dad died when he was a child from diabetes) and I was okay with that argument, but in trying to explain his health concerns, he kept digressing into such gems as: \\nI‚Äôm not gonna stay married to you if i don‚Äôt get hard looking at you\\nDo you want our kids to be embarrassed by you? Do you want them to say ‚Äúdaddy, can you drop us off as school instead of mommy, because the other kids make fun of the way mommy waddles?\\nI love you, but my love is conditional, and the condition is not gaining more than 30 pounds. When the scale hits 31, I‚Äôm signing the divorce papers.\\nIf you told me not to weigh 300 lbs, I‚Äôd say ‚Äúsure thing, babe, you‚Äôre right‚Äù but the fact that you won‚Äôt agree to it means that you must actually WANT to weigh 300 lbs, so if that‚Äôs your goal, good luck but we‚Äôre breaking up if that‚Äôs what you want\\nDo you want our kids to be fat fucks too? You want to give them insulin shots in kindergarten because you and the babies sit on the couch all day feeding each other Ding Dongs? \\n\\nWe‚Äôve had a lot of fights in the past around my boyfriend being blunt by nature, and me being overly sensitive by nature, but I really think he was out of line. And the whole conversation came out of nowhere, which really makes me feel like my weight is something that was just eating away at him and he had to get it off his chest. But should I just let it go if he insists he‚Äôs only worried about my health? With his family history, it‚Äôs understandable that he‚Äôd worry about obesity and have a bit of a complex around it, and he is insisting that he‚Äôs not asking for too much so I should just agree to it since gaining minimal weight is also what I want, so I shouldn‚Äôt fight him and we just be in agreement?\\n\\n',\n",

I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I\\'m not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it\\'s important to the story. \\n\\n\\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She\\'s actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn\\'t mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It\\'s not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \\n\\n\\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \\n\\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I\\'m working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it\\'s literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That\\'s all there is too it. \\n\\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \\n\\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I\\'m really sorry, but you just aren\\'t a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \\n\\n\\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I\\'d always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that\\'s why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I\\'ve known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \\n\\n\\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I\\'m an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I\\'m an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \\n\\n\\nthank you for reading. \\n',\n",

Originally, he was going to enroll in EMT certification classes through community college, but there ended up being some issue with his application too close to the deadline or something. Since that fell through, he intended to get a job and reapply to school in the summer. Last year he was doing life guarding and intends to do that this spring/summer as well but needs income in the interim.\\n\\nFast forward to now, he applied for a position at a well-known grocery store chain in our state as a checker but ended up not getting it. He told me that he reapplied for an ‚Äúovernight position‚Äù though and after interviewing last week he confirmed he got hired. I didn‚Äôt ask too many questions about it so I could congratulate him in person over the weekend ‚Äì but I assumed an overnight position meant like a stocker. \\n\\nSo we‚Äôre out to eat this weekend and I was asking when he starts, what his hours will be, etc. Then I clarified if he is going to be a stocker? Nope, he‚Äôs going to be the overnight janitor. ***A fucking janitor.*** I explained to him that a kid who went to my high school who has a mental disability and lives at home is also a janitor at this grocery store. \\n\\nBy no means am I above him, but I have a college degree, work a salaried job making $60k+ annually, and own my town home but I am legitimately embarrassed to tell my friends/family about his new job as an overnight janitor. His standpoint is that he will only have this job for a few months before life guarding picks back up and ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a job‚Äù. \\n\\nTL;DR My boyfriend got a job as an overnight janitor at a grocery store and I‚Äôm embarrassed by it.',\n",

I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\\n\\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \\n\\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

       " 'On Sunday afternoon I was shopping at the grocery store around the corner from my house. I don\\'t want to say the name because I\\'m worried about this getting on social media and I\\'m almost positive I saw people filming with their phones (also posting from a one time use account for that reason), but it\\'s a national chain that\\'s focus is affordable health food. Think whole foods with bigger variety and way cheaper prices. Because of this, I know a lot of vegans and vegetarians shop there but this place has a full butcher shop, fish place and deli counter. It has vegan products but is not vegan to put it succinctly. \\n\\nI was in the soup aisle and I was checking out the bone broth when I hear something from behind me. Thinking back I THINK she said something like \"you shouldn\\'t eat that, it\\'s murder.\" But I honestly didn\\'t hear her so I turned around and said \"thank you.\" This is all such a blur please don\\'t quote me on any of this, it\\'s just the best of my recollection. \\n\\n\\nHer: \"your body will THANK YOU, as will all the animals.\"\\n\\n\\nMe: really confused \"thank you.\"\\n\\n\\nI set the box of broth I was looking at down and found a store brand that was much cheaper and put in my basket. \\n\\n\\nHer: \"wait, I thought you weren\\'t buying that?\"\\n\\n\\nMe: \"excuse me?\"\\n\\n\\nHer: \"you agreed that meat was murder.\"\\n\\n\\nMe: \"no I\\'m sorry, I eat meat.\" \\n\\n\\nThis is where I start to think something was really, really wrong with her. \\n\\n\\nHer: \"you PROMISED me, you PROMISED me!

       " 'I am currently in the midst of planning my wedding, which my fiance and I just set a date for this coming summer. I\\'ve spent most of the last few weeks getting together with friends to do the whole \"will you be my bridesmaid?\" thing. The group consists of a mix of friends from work, college, and childhood. The latter is where my potential assholeness arises. I have a couple of friends that I\\'ve had literally since grade school. Their names are Kristy and Erin. Kristy is my absolute best friend in the whole wide world, like the sister I never had. Erin and I aren\\'t as close as we once were, but that\\'s mostly just because we went to different universities and naturally grew apart a bit. That being said, the three of us have maintained a group text and have continually gotten together to hang out over the years, so Erin is still a very close friend. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTherefore it stood out when I didn\\'t include her in my group of bridesmaids. I had hoped that it wouldn\\'t be an issue because we had grown apart a little bit, but I could tell something was up after all my bridesmaids were posting on social media about me having asked them because Erin started being standoffish. Then I asked Erin to be in the house party, and her reaction was lukewarm at best. I asked Kristy about it later and she told me that Erin\\'s feelings were hurt and then asked me why I didn\\'t include Erin, and I told her the truth.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nErin has MASSIVE breasts. Literally bigger than should be physiologically possible because she has a hormone disorder that caused her breasts to grow to an excessive degree. We (as in Erin\\'s mom, doctor, Kristy, me, and just about everyone else important in Erin\\'s life) have been encouraging her to get a breast reduction surgery for years now, but she just won\\'t follow through with it because she\\'s terrified of surgery. That\\'s beside the point though. I originally planned on asking Erin to be a bridesmaid, but then I started thinking about the logistics of getting a bridesmaid dress tailored to fit her dimensions and how she won\\'t be capable of wearing a strapless dress because she can\\'t do strapless bras. Also Erin has these shoulder pads for her bra straps that she\\'s insecure about, so she would need a dress with sleeves realistically, and does that mean I have to settle on a bridesmaid dress with sleeves for all the girls to wear in the heat of summer? Or does Erin have to be the only one wearing a different dress? It stressed me out immensely, and I felt that it would be borderline impossible to find a resolution that wouldn\\'t somehow embarrass and/or ostracize Erin.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd here\\'s the other issue that might be flirting with \\'Bridezilla\\' territory. Part of me has a fear that Erin\\'s presence would be a distraction. Like I said before, I\\'ve been Erin\\'s friend since we were kids. I\\'ve been there through it all, and I have seen how people react to her situation. When people think back on my wedding, I want them to think about how beautiful the venue was, or how nice the wedding party looked, or (dare I say) my fiance and I finally getting hitched! I don\\'t want people to remember my wedding for the bridesmaid with the giant boobs. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI told Kristy these feelings and she more or less told me I was being an asshole. She said it more kindly than that, but it\\'s the same sentiment regardless lol. And honestly I recognize that she might be correct, because I\\'m being selfish...but then I also think that if ever there\\'s a time I can be a little selfish then it\\'s probably my wedding day. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not asking Erin to be a bridesmaid?\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for your thoughts. I posted this recognizing that I was being at least a bit of an asshole, but I failed to fully comprehend the depth of my assholery, and more importantly how this seemingly insignificant bit of shallow exclusivity could hurt my friend on a deep level. This is so not worth losing a friend over, and I want to thank many of you for helping me to rediscover some perspective that I lost in the midst of planning for my wedding. I plan to sit down with Erin, apologize, and do what I can to fix the situation. I will provide an update on how that conversation goes if people are interested. Either way, I really am grateful, and DEEPLY humbled, by this response. ',\n",

So including me 16. I got to the office where we had it and was so surprised to see Madison sitting there. So that made it 17 people. The guy who has been on the team the longest  basically said that in light of what happened Sunday, he would do the talking. This really annoyed me but i remembered how much bad feedback I got here and didn‚Äôt say anything. \\n\\nThey started off by having Madison say her thing. I have to admit she was very rational and but she did start crying which made me really uncomfortable. But basically her point was she just moved her for grad school, she didn‚Äôt want to do the bar and club scene anymore and she said the loved all of us for never asking her out or making her feel uncomfortable and it was the first time she felt like she ever found a group of people, including her sorority, where people didn‚Äôt judge her for her looks. I was like sure, whatever you think but come on. Anyways she said she was really sorry for not keeping our standards and she was just trying to have fun and she is a girl and doing crazy things with her hair or wearing pink camo is just in her mind set. She asked me if I would please consider if I she could stay on the team. \\n\\nI was totally on the spot so I was just started out by saying that I was sorry and I overreacted. But then I said I think it‚Äôs best if I step down because it was obvious I take it too seriously and if 5 people quit in the spot, obviously it was time for a change. But as long as I was still doing it, I was happy to have her back. \\n\\nSo that lifted a huge weight in the room. So we got into more business and it turns out that the reason Madison had not bought her competition gear is because she was reaching out to various companies using her ‚Äúinsta-fame‚Äù to get our team sponsored. She said the reason she didn‚Äôt tell me anything because these deals are very tenuous and she didn‚Äôt want to let us down if they fell through. So she‚Äôs still working on the uniform stuff but she did get an incredible deal to become a representative for an ammo company so starting with the tournament in March we will have absolutely free airsoft pellets, which for a team of 20 people who play mostly every weekend is huge. She is starting an airsoft specific Instagram and she expects it will take off and she‚Äôll get deals for the team. I‚Äôm literally blown away by her generosity and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll make some income from it, but she‚Äôs choosing to share with us after the way I treated her. \\n\\nBut anyways so we talked about more team business and we decided that we would sort of split the leadership position in that we would have an adminstrator for day to day stuff and that‚Äôs going to be the guy who started the meeting but everyone was happy with how I managed the team for tournaments so I‚Äôll be in charge of all tournament related business and conduct at tournaments.  We also agreed that we would dramatically loosen the uniform requirements for weekend local play and Madison (or anyone I guess) could wear her pink camo or do her hair in bright red pony tail puffs as long as she was being safe (no belly shirts) but tournaments we would still have our team unforms.\\n\\nSo that is where we are. Team is still together, we get a bunch of free stuff and maybe more on the way. Madison is cool but it was the first time a teammate hugged me after a meeting but I guess we have to adjust to hugging and crying at our meetings.

Glamorous job right? I\\'m not picky. I just need some extra money to help my mom out. I currently don\\'t have any job experience, embarrassing, I know. So I thought I could start off simple with a low entry level job. \\n\\n\\nWhen getting to this interview I had been coached by the agency and had decent attire. Upon meeting the manager, I gave him a short resume of what I have done (work related experiences and my academic achievements which are usually impressive to schools but not employers)\\n\\n\\nHe says \"These are all white lies. This is not real experience\" \\n\\n\\nMe: \"It might not be relevant for dishwashing but I am competent enough to clean a dish\"\\n\\nHim: \"I have applicants with THIS much experience\" and he gestures with his hand a thick shape to suggest a large resume. \\n\\n\\nMe:\" I guess we are done here then\" \\n\\nAnd I just get up and leave. it didn\\'t seem like he was really going to consider me and I felt insulted. He called the agency and complained that I got up and abandoned the interview in the middle of it and wasted his time. The agency said to me that you \"NEVER leave an interview \" .\\n\\n\\nAm I the asshole here for walking away? ',\n",
       " \"On mobile and all that, so sorry about that.\\n\\nOk, I'm in this dilemma. When I met my wife 10 years ago, she had a 1 year old. His real dad is a complete dumpster, never wanted to have anything to do with her or her son.\\nI love them both, and I marry her a year later. Then we have another son, B, who is healthy and amazing. For three years, we're all happy. We were saving for a house, both working, and taking care of our two boys.\\nThen we hit a rough patch. Money is tight, with daycare and neither of us had gone to college, but we're doing well, established in our respective industries. Then she starts to slip, spending time out of the house more, going out with friends. I'm ok with this, since she didn't have a traditional post high school life since she was pregnant her senior year of high school. But then she goes silent, and we rarely talk. Then on a Tuesday, she announces she's leaving.\\nShe grabbed some stuff and went to live with a dude she met at work, and had been seeing on the sly when I was home with the kids.\\nFast forward a few months, and she's back in town, her and her new BF have an apartment, and has more contact with our two sons.\\nThen she gets pregnant with BF's kid, C.\\nFast forward another few years, and they all live with her and BF and I see my two boys on the weekend.\\nFast forward until last fall, they both get arrested, and DHS removed all kids, giving me full custody of my two sons, and placing the youngest with her sister. If her sister doesn't take him, he could be placed in foster care.\\nNow I've spoken to my son's, and they both are kind indifferent to the youngest, C. C was treated like a prince, while A and B were both constantly ragged on by EX and BF.\\nSo the question, am I the asshole for not wanting to take in the youngest? He's not my son, and I've had very little contact with him.\\n\\n(I've kept this very non descript because I don't want anyone I know to find out I'm reaching out)\\n\\nEDIT- Thank you everyone for commenting. Maybe I can sleep a little (just a little) knowing I've tried my best.  My boys are very important to me, and im going to continue supporting and loving them with everything ive got, and will be honest with them about everything. But someone's gotta get them up for school tomorrow, so good night to all you AITA folks.\",\n",
       " ' This happened 3 months ago and I got a court date for the case now. I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\\n\\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\\n\\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let\\'s call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it\\'s Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn\\'t have any sign and just dress normally.\\n\\nKaren next response was \"oh so it\\'s pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\\n\\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don\\'t think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo AITA?',\n",
       " \"A little background, I was swamped with tons of work today and asked my husband if he would be able to clean our gecko‚Äôs cage as she had pooed today. He proceeded to do so and an hour later I decide to take a break and lay down on our bed. Only I can‚Äôt nap because of a REALLY STRONG smell of shit. So I look over and there‚Äôs a pile of my freshly washed intimates that he‚Äôd thrown on the bed to sort later. I think ‚Äúholy crap, did I leave skid marks or something on these??‚Äù I go to sort through it but quickly stopped when I realized what it was. He‚Äôd grabbed the cage liner and left it on my clean underwear and a pillow. I‚Äôm horrified and ask him why there‚Äôs gecko poop on our bed. He can‚Äôt answer me, just apologizes and grabs the liner and throws it away in our trash bin. As a germaphobe, I just sit there shellshocked. He comes back and starts putting the underwear up in my drawer and I scream at him because:\\n1) He didn‚Äôt wash his hands after he touched the big fat poop.\\n2) Now the rest of my underwear has gecko poop essence on it. \\n3) Gecko is in quarantine until she‚Äôs clear of Giardia. So it‚Äôs not even a solid #2 \\n\\nAfter I yell at him, I grab everything off the bed and from my drawer and throw it in the washer. He‚Äôs now in the other room acting hurt. I can‚Äôt understand why a rational person would just nonchalantly throw poop on their bed. On the pillow they put their face on. The underwear that cover‚Äôs their wife‚Äôs goods. He doesn‚Äôt go to school and he hasn‚Äôt had to go to work in 5 days. Meanwhile I‚Äôm here doing 16 hours at school and working 2 part time jobs to support us. I just don‚Äôt understand how someone can be so non-functional. I‚Äôm trying to formulate an apology but I honestly can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm so disgusted I want to cry. It was really big and messy poop that had soaked through the liner. \\n\\nEdit to update that I actually apologized an hour-ish after this happened. We went to bed together (on new sheets) and said a few things to each other when I woke up for school. We agreed was that while I was right to be angry, my response was inappropriate and I have to work on that (I signed up for therapy in school). He works in retail and his hours have been cut tremendously, not his fault. But I was able to tell him that I need more help around the house and for him to be more mindful. I ended up just throwing away my underwear and the pillow (we are shopping this weekend). Yeah, I‚Äôm the asshole.  \\n\\nEdit again: I accidentally used his account when replying to a comment with some more background information. We just got a house. At 23 I'm paranoid of losing this house because I've worked EXTREMELY hard for this place. I took on a second job in EMS to make up for the hours he was going to be losing after the holidays. He's just finished his associates degree in december and we agreed he'd take spring off to really develop a career path/plan out what he wants to do with his life. I told him to take this time to volunteer at a museum, donate his graphic design skills to local nonprofits, help out a tax preparer office to see if a career in art/accounting. I began to feel used when he spent all of January on league (we talked). He forgot to tell me his first day a local art museum was today. We really need to work on communication.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m going to try to explain this as clearly as possible. \\n\\nI have an adult friend with autism. We will call him \"John\" He lives on his own, has a job, and you wouldn\\'t know anything is amiss until he opens his mouth and shows his complete and utter lack of understanding of social norms. You can imagine this doesn\\'t make him very popular. He\\'s a good man, just definitely autistic. \\n\\nWe have a mutual friend. We\\'ll call her \"Sarah\". Sarah was dating John\\'s friend (We\\'ll call him \"Asshole\") when he raped her. I\\'ll skip the details but this has had a major impact on Sarah\\'s life, as well as her entire family. This was several years ago. Asshole is in jail now. \\n\\nA few weeks ago I was talking to Sarah and said something about John. She became very angry because a few weeks ago he implied that she wasn\\'t actually raped. I\\'m sure whatever he said came across that way (Like I said he\\'s not a good talker), but I didn\\'t think he meant it like that. Well last week I asked John about it and yup that\\'s exactly what he meant. \\n\\nApparently, Asshole told John that Sarah was making it up because he wanted to dump her, or some nonsense like that. From the sound of it John still had contact with Asshole. We talked about this for at least an hour and he finally realized that Asshole was lying to him. He didn\\'t take it well and we haven\\'t spoke much since. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what I accomplished. Sarah (understandably) isn\\'t interested in being friends with John anymore. And Asshole is in jail so it\\'s not like anything changed there. I feel like I hurt John for no reason, and he would have been happier to be ignorant. \\n\\nEDIT: Wow I logged out for a few days. Didn\\'t expect this to blow up. I feel a lot better guys thank you. ',\n",

Today, I got a text from the parents saying that their child got sent home from school for having  a fever and vomiting. I was expecting them to cancel, but nope. I have a really important interview to do tomorrow and I have major events going on this weekend. I cannot afford to be sick for them, so I apologized profusely and told them I cannot babysit a sick child. Additionally, I work at a preschool, so I would also be risking passing the illness to 20 three year olds. The parents were not happy and accused me of ruining their Valentine‚Äôs Day. AITA?',\n",
       " 'On mobile, blah blah blah, etc. \\n\\nTLDR: Husband started snapping coworker when she was 17 (now 18) and allegedly removed her from his snap list when my SIL, her husband, and I told him it was inappropriate. Thought that was that. Two days ago, I found that they‚Äôre friends again and they‚Äôve been exchanging conversation. \\n\\nMy husband and I have been married for 2 years, and I am 8 weeks pregnant. He is in a management role at at a local large gas station/convenience store. Last fall, I found out that he was exchanging Snapchats with a young coworker, who was 17 years old at the time. I told him that I was wildly uncomfortable with their contact and that it was inappropriate. He told me that it wasn‚Äôt like that, that it was kind of weird but that he felt bad for her because she doesn‚Äôt have a lot of friends. (I‚Äôm not sure how true this is because she post some pretty risqu√©/sexy photos online.)\\n\\nFast forward to Christmas, and we are with his family. I bring up the issue to his sister and husband because we are very close with them and I trust their opinions. They both agreed with me, telling him he needed to stop what he was doing immediately. He said he deleted her on Snapchat and I thought it was done. \\n\\nFast forward to about 3 weeks ago, my husband and I join an xbox live party with a couple of my husband‚Äôs coworkers, not knowing that this teenage girl was one of them. She doesn‚Äôt say a word and immediately signs off. I find out after some probing that she‚Äôs been upset about my husband deleting her and that he blamed his cutting contact entirely on me. He did this by telling her that he deleted her because I was uncomfortable. I was pretty unfazed by this because it apparently wasn‚Äôt affecting their work relationship so I figured she‚Äôd get over not being Snapchat buddies. \\n\\nTwo days ago, my husband is in the shower. My husband‚Äôs phone starts ringing. I look and see it‚Äôs a telemarketer so I double click the lock button to end the call and see a Snapchat from coworker on the lock screen. Immediately, I‚Äôm furious. I go to the bathroom and say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know whether to be angry with you or furious right now.‚Äù He asks what I‚Äôm talking about and I tell him what I saw. He goes silent for a moment and then says, ‚ÄúShe added me back. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I walk out and he finishes his shower. He comes out to get dressed and again says he‚Äôs sorry and that he‚Äôs a piece of shit. I didn‚Äôt really acknowledge him because I was still so upset. \\n\\nI‚Äôve taken the last two days to think and I can‚Äôt begin to understand why this girl is so important to have a friendship with. I trust my husband completely and I know that he hasn‚Äôt been unfaithful because he literally has no time to be. He‚Äôs always either at work, at school, or at home with me. \\n\\nI told him today that I‚Äôm upset and we would talk about this when he gets home from work tonight. I don‚Äôt think I should be having to have this conversation again about how inappropriate I feel this friendship is but the other part of me is wondering if I‚Äôm an asshole for trying to stop my husband from being friends with a coworker. \\n\\nSo, Reddit, AITA here?\\n\\nUPDATE: I spoke with my husband last night after he came home from work. I laid out a lot of the points made here but I emphasized how upset/betrayed I was by him re-adding her behind my back. He conceded that he knew I would be upset by this so that is why he didn‚Äôt tell me. However, he was genuinely concerned by some of the points that Redditors had made such as how her parents might feel, how it reflected on him professionally, etc. He deleted her again on Snapchat and we‚Äôve agreed to have an open communication about their relationship going forward. He did tell me that they did not, in his opinion, have any conversations that were more than friendly. They talked about work, school, and another coworker that she, apparently, has a crush on.\\n\\nFor all the people who called me jealous and/or controlling, the issue here was never the friendship with his coworker. He has plenty of female friends and coworkers with whom I have no issue. The problem I had was that he lied to me and went behind my back to continue speaking with her after several adults told him a 30 year old man should not be Snapchatting with a 17/18 year old high school student. \\n\\nI appreciate everyone‚Äôs advice and I hope that my discussion with my husband will allow for a more open communication going forward.

       " \" \\n\\nThrowaway account for reasons.\\n\\nMy wife (28) and I (32) have been together for 13 years, married for 8. We‚Äôve always been very close and have agreed on pretty much everything so far in our relationship. We‚Äôve also always been monogamous. Skip to about a month ago and while discussing ways in which we can learn to love the other better, she drops on me that she thinks she is polyamorous and wants to open our relationship. \\n\\nI am strongly against this and was really torn up about it after she told me. I soon came to find out that prior to telling me that she was poly she had fallen in love with another guy she met online whom she had been talking to for a couple months. I also found out that not only did she sext with him but she was sharing with this guy my private messages to her regarding her wanting to be poly, and he was starting to frame me as a ‚Äúvillain‚Äù (his actual words) in this situation, at one point even trying to convince her that he was positive that I was spying on their messages (which I wasn‚Äôt). Asshole guy aside, I always thought we were in sync with each other and always honest with each other, so needless to say, I was devastated to find out that she had an emotional affair and violated my trust in such a hurtful way.\\n\\nI am very uncomfortable with the idea of an open relationship. It is not what I want nor ever anticipated for our relationship, and it is not a situation in which I feel that I will be happy. Even if I try to look at it objectively, I‚Äôm honestly not getting anything positive from such an arrangement. She has said that I am free to be with whomever I want as well, but I don‚Äôt want that. \\n\\nBut even with how much it hurts me, even with how clear I have been that I am not comfortable with it, she has been pushing the issue more and more and keeps going against every compromise we have agreed to and I feel like I am being forced into it. She now says that monogamy is too restraining and binding and she wants total freedom. But she also still wants to stay together, so I feel like she wants to have her cake and eat it too. \\n\\nShe has a lot of baggage from childhood about not feeling accepted for her sexuality (she is pansexual) and also from sexual abuse and a past abusive relationship, and from what she has shared with me she feels that being poly will make her happy by giving her total control over her body and by allowing her to express and accept herself fully. But I can‚Äôt get to a place of being okay with it. I cannot willingly consent to it right now. It makes me sick to my stomach to think of her with someone else. I can also already feel resentment and anger building in me just by the way I feel I have been treated throughout this whole thing and feeling like she isn‚Äôt willing to stick to any compromises, or even see my side of it, and in some ways I feel like I have been treated like a doormat. It feels like she doesn‚Äôt want to give me the time I need to try and be okay with it, she just wants what she wants right now. She also seems to have this naive, self-righteousness about her belief in poly, like more love in the form of multiple romantic partners can‚Äôt possibly be a bad thing. She has said that she would never leave me and wants our relationship to be strong, but at the same time she won‚Äôt take no for an answer. \\n\\nI am trying really hard to somehow be okay with this because I do love her greatly and want to give her what she wants, but at the same time I wonder, what about what I want? I don‚Äôt think poly is something I can give her without sacrificing a part of myself that will cause me pain and unhappiness and I don't know if it's something I could ever become okay with. AITA for not being able to agree to this for her?\",\n",

She said no.\\n\\nApparently my mom gives my old clothes to him . \\n\\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll stand up to my parents.

We were there for 5 minutes and they didn‚Äôt mention we were doing this as a family. The Christmas play was late night and really long so it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted to do on my Saturday night.

       " 'Let me explain myself before you offer judgement please. \\n\\nThis is driving me absolutely insane and turned into a fight for the first time last night. My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she\\'ll eat off my plate if we order different things. I\\'m very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she\\'ll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don\\'t want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That\\'s why I ordered it.\\n\\nTo solve this, I\\'ve told her I\\'m alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I\\'ll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I\\'m having. I\\'ve said I\\'d pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I\\'ve tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\\n\\nShe acts like it\\'s playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I\\'m competing for my own food because she\\'s taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she\\'ll say she isn\\'t hungry then eat mine. I\\'ve told her I wouldn\\'t bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\\n\\nIt\\'s one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \\n\\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, something she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn\\'t want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I\\'m just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\\n\\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I\\'ve explained a million times before and telling her that if it\\'s just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I\\'d still get to have a full meal.

Since then he has successfully gotten his life back together.   \\nHe recently moved back into town and is married, with a kid of his own. I don\\'t hold a grudge, but I refuse to have anything to do with him. He scared the living crap out of me.   \\nThe problem is that we live in a rural area. His wife comes into the store all the time, but when Zack comes by, I refuse to serve him. Everyone knows what happened because it\\'s a small town and I wasn\\'t quiet about what he did. I told everybody what happened. So did my sisters and brother.   \\nWe are in our thirties now and I still don\\'t want anything to do with him. I don\\'t believe I need to be the bigger person. I don\\'t care that he is sober. I could care less about his life. I am 100% okay with serving his wife, I just won\\'t serve him.  \\nBecause of this, my manager has asked if I want Zack banned. I said I would like that because I still get this feeling in my gut that\\'s a mix between fear and anger. I have been to therapy, but the moment still haunts me. I think I might have PTSD, but have not been diagnoses. But it feels like I am back in that moment when I see his face.   \\nHis wife came to talk to me the other day. She says Zack has expressed multiple times that he is sorry for what happened. I told her I didn\\'t care, he could have killed me, she is free to shop here but he is not. And my manager agrees. He is not welcome.   \\nAITA? ',\n",
       " \"I know the title sounds awful but please read the full story. Every time I walk to my gym I see this cute little dog looking miserable. The dog (it‚Äôs a she) is sometimes with her owner, a homeless guy in his 40s, but most of the time she gets tied to a pole and left there for hours. I wanted to report this to authorities but I was told that because most shelters in our area are kill shelters that could be even worse for the dog. Recently it‚Äôs been showing a lot in my city and seeing the poor dog tied to the pole was just too much. A few nights ago my fianc√© and I were walking back from a restaurant in the area and saw the dog alone again, we decided to take her home. When I told my mother she was outraged, she says homeless people need their animals to keep them company and that I had no right to take her. I told her a dog isn‚Äôt a toy and people shouldn‚Äôt get one if they can‚Äôt look after it. My mom says I‚Äôm cruel and don‚Äôt care about human beings. I disagree and maintain that you should not have an animal you can‚Äôt take care of. We took the dog to the vet, he said she‚Äôs a little over a year, malnourished but not critically. We scheduled her shots and made sure she was okay. The plan is either to keep her or let my aunt‚Äôs family adopt her. We have two cats (they‚Äôre used to dogs) and we‚Äôre leaving our apartment to live in a house with a backyard in a few months. On the other and my 8 year old cousin fell in love with the dog from the moment she saw her. Regardless, we all live in the same city and will be there for the doggy to shower her with love. I just hope my mom gets over it.\\n\\n*For anyone wondering about the legality of what I did, my vet helped me out to make sure the dog was reported as abandoned and everything was legal. We‚Äôll be able to make the adoption official after a 30 day wait period.*\\n\\nUPDATE: as suggested by some of you in the comments, yesterday my fianc√© and my brother went to talk to the homeless guy to let him know where the dog is and how to claim ownership. However, authorities ruled this as animal abuse, so if the guy does claim ownership he can face charges (the guy knows this as well). Typically the waiting period for us to adopt the dog if the owner doesn't claim her would be 30 days, but because this is a case of abuse we might be able to finalize the adoption earlier. Seems like my aunt will adopt the dog since they're a family of 5 and someone's always home to take care of the dog. I understand the people telling me I should have talked to the guy earlier and I was a coward for not doing it. For people asking about temperatures, my city is in the mountains in northern Europe, snow and sub-freezing temperatures are a regular occurrence here. For people telling me to return the dog because the homeless guy is lonely, animals don't exist for our entertainment and loneliness isn't a valid excuse for animal abuse. Plenty of homeless people care for their animals and don't leave them alone in the cold.\",\n",

I was happy, I wanted to wait, but it wasn't the end of the world that it came a bit earlier than I had planned.\\n\\nWhen she left for the night, I went out and bought my own pregnancy test.

It sucks that they're in this situation, but they chose to have children at their advanced age despite the risks. So really, that's a them problem.

       " \"A little background:  I own a business earning $150k+ a year that I built from the ground up. I have never seen a successful marriage in my family, especially the one between my parents. Each of them tried to screw with the other constantly, no matter the cost. I do have some pretty deep-seated trust issues as a result of that (really trying to work on this), and I've never really seen marriage as a necessity. \\n\\n\\nThe other day my girlfriend(26) and I(27) were discussing marriage. We've been together for about 3 years, and living together for about 1 and a half. I told her that I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to get married, and if I did, I would want a prenup. Shit really hit the fan after that.  She called me a distrustful asshole and that she felt insulted that I would even consider that, and hurt that I might never want to get married. I tried to tell her that it wasn't about not trusting her, but having security for myself, along with the above information. She wouldn't have any of it though. \\n\\nSo AITA?\\n\\nEdit:  To those saying I should leave her and that she is a gold digger, that couldn't be farther from the truth. She is amazing. She always pays her way for everything. Bills, rent, dinners, she always wants it 50/50. I dont think I painted her in the best light. I wouldnt even consider leaving her after this, though I cant say the same for her. Marriage is an issue for me, and always has been. I dont have faith in myself more than anything. If I were ever to get married, it would probably be to her. My reservations are from my issues and past experiences. She's never given me a reason to not trust her, but I've seen how people can change. I have a lot to think about. Thank you all for everything. \",\n",

I asked her a couple times to be sure that was a good idea and she reassured me it was fine. \\n\\nWe arrive to the restaurant and she\\'s already starting to slur her words. Now mind you, we didn\\'t go to Chili\\'s. We actually went to the most expensive restaurant either of us ever ate at. Ended up being $240.

I\\'m using a throw away account for obvious reasons and am typing this on mobile so please forgive any spelling errors, spellcheck has it out for me. \\n\\nI recently left a long term relationship and am out on the dating scene again. I\\'ve been using dating apps and online dating sites since I find I usually have better luck talking to people also interested in dating. Like everyone else, I put what is important to me in my bio. One of my few deal breakers is kids, I dont want any and I dont want to date someone who had them or wants them. There are many reasons for this, but it really boils down to incompatibility. Wanting children vs not puts us on very different paths in life. I hold to this rule no matter what, if a guy has a kid in his bio I pass, if i find out he has them/wants them after talking I walk away. I\\'m in my mid twenties and am looking for a guy around my age which means some guys will already have kids so I keep this in my bio to preemptively weed them out.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t stop guys from lying or matching with me just to complain about how I am selfish, rude, too dumb to know what I want, am missing out on the greatest joy in life, etc. I can deal with internet trolls and usually just brush it off. \\n\\nRecently, however, a friend of mine set me up with a single friend of hers from college. He seemed nice and I trusted her judgement that he was great and we shared lots of mutual interests. We went on a first date and things were really great. He was funny and sweet and liked the same sports teams. I was really interested in him and had a great time.\\n\\nOn our second date I decided to test the waters and asked \"where do you see yourself in 5 years?\" Which is my go to question for probing their interest in a family. Most people who see families in their future bring it up when talking about the future. His response was fine, he wanted a promotion, to move to a new city and settle down. I was a bit disappointed that he wanted a family but didnt react since I didnt want to ruin the date. We kept talking about our city and why he wanted to leave and he said to be further from his ex. Turns out he has a young son from a previous relationship and was having trouble co parenting so he wanted to move away. Super big deal breaker for me. His attitude at that point was terrible, really just venting about his parenting woes, and he could tell I wasnt interested anymore. The date wrapped up and we went our separate ways. He asked about a third date and I told him I didnt know what my schedule was like. I wanted to let him down easier the next day than right after I found out.\\n\\nLater that night he started texting me asking what he did wrong. I was honest and told him that kids were a deal breaker for me which is when he went off. I got a whole string of abusive texts about how I was bigoted and didnt know how hard it was being a single parent. That I am a bitch for not dating single dads and that no one would want me if i wouldn\\'t give them children or raise their existing kids. I usually dont let this kind of thing affect me but this particular bad date hurts worse since he actually got to know me and before he had a kid he seemed like a great guy.\\n\\nI got a text from him today apologizing and talking about how he was just frustrated since he gets turned down a lot. He wants me to give him another chance and claims that his kid won\\'t have any impact on our dating which I dont believe to be true. \\n\\nSo am I really the asshole for refusing to date an otherwise good guy because he has a kid?\\n\\nEdit to add: I am not considering dating him anymore because of how nasty he was to me. However this has gotten me thinking in general on him I\\'m being an asshole to all the other guys who want kids that I pass on.',\n",

The waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.\\n\\nMy friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but I was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.\\n\\nAs the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend‚Äôs husband with the check. My friend‚Äôs husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, ‚ÄúI know this isn‚Äôt how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. We told you that.‚Äù I suddenly started panicking inside. I was trying to catch someone else‚Äôs eye to see if they were panicking as much as I was. One other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. I opened the check, and the total was $211. I thought I was going to throw up. I have never spent that much on a meal.\\n\\nI held my shit together because I didn‚Äôt want to make a scene. The couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn‚Äôt paying.

So the time has come, that E and her grandma went into the sauna and I took the opportunity to go through her phone. I opened Whatsapp and oh god look what we\\'ve found. I saw hearts behind every message, he saying \"Lets fuck\", \"when can we met to fuck\" and other explicit things.

       " 'Last week our neighbor begged me to watch her daughter two hours before she had to leave. I was at home anyway and had the kids for the whole day. I promissed my kids the day before, that we would watch Guardians of the Galaxy (they allways wanted to see Groot and Rocket in action). Since the movie is okish for kids, and I was sitting there to pause or explain stuff if something needed explaining I didn\\'t see a problem. So I informed the mother that I would take care of her kid and that we would watch a movie that is pg12 but that I think can be watched by a 9 year old without problem. And that I even would let my boys (5) watch it with us ...\\nThe mother seemed stressed, said something like \"yea whatever, thanks, I\\'ll send her by two o\\'clock and went away....\"\\nSo the girl came at two. I went to the park with the kids, played hide and seek, and some soccer. We went home, I made smoothies, fruit and Pop Corn. Then I talked to the girl (who doesn\\'t watch TV at home at all), to make sure she was ok with the movie, that I could play something else with her, and if we would watch it and she would feel fear or overwhelmed she just should say something and I would pause it and we would just do something else ...\\nShe watched the movie, she loved it, she was really happy. My kids, specially the boys loved it to. Everyone was happy. Then came the mother, took her happy child home... the day after she informed my wife that she won\\'t bring her kid to us anymore when I am arround because I only put the kids in front of the TV and show them inapropriate content... Well apart that her statement is not true, it made me think if I should have showed the movie to my kids ... I came to the conclusion that it is totally ok for my kids who are used to TV and cinema (I\\'m a Film Art MA, so a big movie nerd...). but might be troublesome for other kids the same age with less experience (visual/narrative knowledge). But I just didn\\'t want to change the plans ... I think I behaved right, but just to hear other voices, AITA?\\n\\nEDIT: WOW this blew up over the night. Firstly thank you, for your inputs. I really was insecure but this really helped me on a personal level. \\nSecondly, the girl next door is a nice girl, she asks questions a lot (wich starts to get annoying after question number 100...) and she has seen stuff in the cinema, it\\'s not like she hasn\\'t been exposed to movies. The mother is indeed a controlish person, but overal niceish, and she has watched my kids too in the past. The fact that it was short notice, was strange (still don\\'t know wtf she had to do that day) but not completly out of place. But she managed to make me insecure about myself and to feel like an AH. I\\'m aware that my kids have seen more movies than their peers and I know that some parents roll their eyes when my daughter wants to play \"singing in the rain\" or \"Harry Potter\" with their kids, who haven\\'t seen it but it\\'s not like we watch movies every day. it is my go to option on a rainy day or once a month I make a surprise movie night. Often we read a book and watch the movie together afterwards. My sons love make in off movies of special effects and make up artists ... so they are aware that they are watching fiction and can snap out of scary situations by starting to think about makeup and editing and stuff... still never would watch something I haven\\'t seen beforehand and which I\\'m not 99% sure they can understand and process properly.  \\nAnd no, I would not change a plan (promise) I made to my kids, because of my neighbor. \\nFinally Guardians of the Galaxy is apropriate, there where two scenes where I had to make a short pause. 1. When Ronan smashes his hammer on the head of a dude and then, just before the impact, it cuts to the blood filling a pool ...you can\\'t see nothing but it\\'s pretty explicit. There I took a short break and explained, that this Ronin is really a bad guy and that he smashed the others foot (not head). The blood was not percieved as such and I didn\\'t mention it. \\nThe second scene is when the red chick grabs the stone at the collectors and blows up ... there also we had a short break where I explained that the stone is so dangerous, that if you touch it you turn into dust .... \\n\\nAnyway thanks for your thaughts. \\n',\n",
       " 'So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won\\'t give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won\\'t go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we\\'re still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i\\'m perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don\\'t plan things on days that aren\\'t ours. And unless it\\'s extremely important we don\\'t \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we\\'ve been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn\\'t mine and I\\'ve never given him one of my days even if he begged. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want\\'s to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it\\'s on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It\\'s my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it\\'s so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can\\'t do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn\\'t even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He\\'s trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it\\'s my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i\\'m only doing this to get back at my ex.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can\\'t tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i\\'m only using my right to spend time with them? ',\n",

       " 'I\\'m generally one of the belief that women should have autonomy regarding their bodies, which is why this is a hard one for me.\\n\\nOriginally when my wife got pregnant I thought nothing of her continuing to smoke, because it was my understanding that as it became more socially acceptable of a habit more research had been done that showed it was safe to use during pregnancy. However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn\\'t smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\\n\\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn\\'t think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It\\'s gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it\\'s worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\\n\\nI feel like what I am asking isn\\'t that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn\\'t even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy. I also feel like I have somewhat of a say because it is our child, and I don\\'t know that I could forgive myself or her if something happened to our child because of it. So, AITA?\\n\\nThanks for your consideration.\\n\\nEdit: For clarification as I\\'m seeing in some comments I may have left some info out, and hopefully to paint my wife in a better picture (she\\'s absolutely wonderful in every other sense): we did of course seek help through the OBGYN and exhausted all options before she asked as a last resort (phenergan, unisom, vitamin B6). She\\'s been to the ER multiple times just to get IV fluids because she\\'s dehydrated as she can\\'t keep down food or water. She\\'s sick and desperately wanting anything to help her out of her situation and she knows that cannabis has helped her nausea in the past. Not trying to absolve her completely but I think context matters. As for me, I was pretty sure this was the response I would get (and I thank many of you for your contributions outside of the judgments), but sometimes when you\\'re in the situation an outside unbiased source can give you insight you didn\\'t have yourself, and I wanted to make sure I wasn\\'t being an asshole to my wife.\\n\\nWe\\'ve since had a discussion and we\\'re both on the same page. I\\'m fairly certain she knew it wasn\\'t best but was just desperate, which is understandable. Thanks again everyone.',\n",

She\\'s funny, charming, and attractive.  I thought I\\'d hit the dating jackpot.  At no point during any of these dates did Sarah mention having a child.\\n\\nWell during our most recent date we went out for drinks and a few minutes after we sat down Sarah came clean.  She admitted she has a daughter from her previous marriage, and that she was afraid to tell me because she knew I\\'d turn her down if I had known ahead of time.  I asked her if that was why she had no reference to her daughter on her profile and she told me she\\'d been turned down so many times because of her daughter that she had to make a new profile.  She said she figured that if I got to know her better she thought I could overlook this \"no kids rule\" that I have and be happy with her.\\n\\nI told her that I couldn\\'t just overlook this.

She told me I was being a selfish asshole and that my hatred of kids was a very ugly trait.  I blocked her.\\n\\nWas I an asshole?  Was I too cold and not understanding enough of her problems here?

       " 'A little backstory, my wife has become vegetarian a few months ago and I have changed my diet to support her. Both our families are meat eaters, and as my sister has young children I sent her the menu weeks in advance to see if it was OK, to which she replied \"I don\\'t think they\\'d eat any of that, but don\\'t worry I\\'ll get the kids something\". A few days before I\\'d also made a general remark to my mother that we (as a human race) don\\'t need to eat meat, as she\\'d asked what kind of food was going to be there.\\n\\nFast forward to the day before, my wife and I spent a lot of time and money preparing a wide variety of vegetarian dishes such as pizza rolls and quiche, with other finger foods and snacks. We\\'d also been planning the party for a long time, getting a cake made, hiring a hall and arranging a soft play for all the kids.\\n\\nIt gets to the day and the whole time my mum is making strange comments to me about the meat industry, asking if we\\'ve made our cats vegetarian too, and even goes up to my wife with some chicken they brought, and goes \"mmm tasty chicken!\". All of this was quite rude I thought, but ignored it as we were there to celebrate our son turning 1.\\n\\nMy mum, step dad and sister all come back to ours afterwards to present a gift to my son, where all hell breaks loose. The three of them begin shouting at us about how we are \"imposing our values\" on them and how we didn\\'t give them a choice for food. This all apparently stemmed from my flippant comment about not needing to eat meat, which seemed to have been marinating in their minds ever since. \\n\\nMy sister\\'s point was that they always accommodate us whenever we see them by preparing vegetarian dishes. My point to them was that the food wasn\\'t the main focus, it was just an extra. The  party was supposed to be about my boy. The whole argument got so bad that my wife was crying and now we don\\'t speak to any of them.\\n\\nPlease let us know... AITA? We\\'re really trying to work out if we were in fact assholes for not preparing any meat dishes. My wife is very much against the meat industry so wouldn\\'t have bought any meat anyway, but they wouldn\\'t accept that either. We didn\\'t realise a 1st birthday party would come down to what food we provided. My wife\\'s family didn\\'t even care about the food.',\n",
       " ' \\n\\nMarried for 8 years. 3 kids - aged 3 to 8. We live in a large 1980\\'s house. When we bought it the plan and my promise was to completely refurbish. We\\'ve done about half the house - thoroughly, but not too much in the last years b/c of lots of work, small kids.\\n\\nMy wife now insists we refurbish the kitchen. The kitchen is now over 30 years old, originally very expensive but now shows its age. It is totally usable though, and in my eyes it\\'s not that bad, though I agree it\\'s not what we really want. But I don\\'t want to fix the kitchen, not unconditionally.\\n\\nShe has a low income job, I\\'m high income. She works 70%, I work well above 150%, many evenings, weekends. I pay 90% of our bills from my salary. The new kitchen will cost $100k+. This will be all up to me to pay. We\\'ve had a few rounds of redecorations earlier, with contractors, and even though we didn\\'t do much of the actual work ourselves - all the things like making plans and detailed decisions, dealing with contractors, buying materials, etc - I had to do it. She prefers to distance herself from these projects, just wants to \"get it done\" but doesn\\'t want to be very involved in the \"doing\".\\n\\nFurthermore, I\\'ve developed this feeling that she doesn\\'t really deserve a new kitchen. She has no real interest in cooking dinner - and thinks that I should be the designated \"gourmet chef\" in the house. Dinner is usually just thrown together in 15 minutes. She has recently turned vegetarian, which I - a meat lover- is decidedly unhappy with. But even these new veggie meals are usually just the same goop as before - minus the meat. I can hardly remember 2 occacions where she made a well-planned and tasty meat meal for me. Otherwise, her dinner priorities is it has to be quick, for the kids, for her, and I just have to eat with my mouth shut.\\n\\nSo I\\'ve told her that she\\'s not getting a new kitchen unless something changes. I want her to gain interest in cooking. I want at least once a week a meal of my liking. I want the purpose for a new kitchen to get better food, not just something to show visitors. I want her to more involved in the project itself, not just showing me pictures from magazines. Things like editing work plans, find serial numbers for items I must buy, and actually talk to contractors herself and not just through me.\\n\\nShe oppose this. Says I owe her and promised her this kitchen. She does most of the cooking anyway (I make dinner 2 times a week), and if I\\'m not happy I can just cook more myself. She must have something in return for all working nights and weekends where she has been left with the kids alone, and that I act like a Scrooge. She feels unempowered since I have veto on major decisions. Since I\\'m paying this and has to see it through, I feel it must be done on my terms. \\n\\nWe have a decent marriage, but this kitchen conflict has become sort of locked.\\n\\nAITA here?',\n",

I really don\\'t understand how she is able to change it so often but I think it\\'s cool.

       " 'I am 46, from Switzerland and come from a pretty dysfunctional family. \\n\\nWhen I was 9, my parents divorced and I went to live with my mother and her new boyfriend, whom she married a year later.My stepfather was extremely abusive to me and my sister, both emotionally and physically, and my mother (and the rest of the family) always looked the other way. My mother and him had a son, and he was never abused. I left the house when I was 18 and moved out of the country but kept in touch with my family sporadically. \\n\\nOver the years, my stepfather changed a lot, attending AA meetings (he has not had a drink in 15 years) and has expressed his regrets for treating us the way he did. I thought I got over my childhood issues and could move on with my life, until a recent incident : last September, my sister, half-brother and I were summoned to a family meeting. There, my stepfather announced that he had contacted a lawyer to ensure that when he dies, his money would not end up in my sister¬¥s and my pockets. \\n\\nBasically, according to the law, if he dies before my mother, she gets half of his estate and my half-brother gets the other half. And then, when my mother dies, what she owns gets divided into 3 equal parts going to her 3 children. But my stepfather sees that as unfair and he does not want the part she¬¥d get when he dies to go to anybody else but to his son. He asked my sister and I to sign a letter the lawyer wrote which said we would give our part of the will to our half-brother.\\n\\nOf course, we refused. My brother looked embarrassed but did not express any objection. My mother, as always, was silent. Seeing how we would not sign it, my stepfather asked us to think about it.\\n\\nFast forward and here comes Christmas, and we are all again reunited. The subject comes up and my stepfather becomes very irritated when we tell him we would not budge. That same night, all the abuse I suffered as a child started to resurface and the next morning, I decided I was going to pack my bags and leave. My stepfather was not there so my mother took the brunt of my anger : I told her that I would never forgive her for not protecting us, that she was as guilty as he was and that I was going to do something that I should have done when I was 18 : break up with them and never see them again. \\n\\nMy sister respects my decision but my brother said I was being too harsh and asked me to reconsider. Apparently my mother and stepfather are devastated by my decision and have tried to reach out to me, but I am very reluctant to accept them back into my life. I don¬¥t think I could ever forgive them. And it is not even about the money, I would actually prefer they donate everything instead of starting this drama.\\n\\nEDIT : the response to my post has been so overwhelming that I cannot answer everyone directly. Thank you so much for all your advice and kind words of support, I really did not expect this. Some people said my header ‚Äúbreaking up with my mom‚Äù was weird, and I agree I should have worded it differently. I‚Äôm new on Reddit and still have a bit to learn, and obviously English is not my first language.\\nFor those who said they think I only care about the money : I don‚Äôt. It is not even my money to start with. And it‚Äôs not the point. It is about a stepfather who decides to be a father when it is time to control, beat, punish, torture and assault, who said that he regrets everything he has done but then bails out when he has a chance to treat us like his own.\\nAnd yes, I have a biological father, who remarried long ago and has children with his new wife. Me, my sister and his wife will inherit from him, as well as my other brothers from that relationship. And my brothers (and my stepmother‚Äôs son from her first marriage) will inherit from their mother (my stepmother) and we won‚Äôt, which is only fair as we haven‚Äôt been raised by her. I have a good relationship with my father but he has lived in Spain with his Spanish wife for over 30 years so we don‚Äôt see each other as often as we‚Äôd like. I told him about everything and he is stunned. Himself as a stepdad he cannot even imagine treating his stepchildren differently to his own blood.\\nSome asked, what if my mother dies first? She has almost nothing to her name, but what little she has will go 1/2 to my stepfather, and the rest to my brother, sister and I.  And then when he dies, we get nothing, which is fair enough as it‚Äôs the law.\\nThanks again everyone, you cannot even imagine how much you helped.',\n",
       " 'AITA So my mom has always been some what (okay a lot) of an authoritarian style parent.  There were a lot of time growing up where I didn\\'t agree with her about something but was not allowed to voice that. And honestly even now, there are some of those times.\\n\\nI love my mom, she\\'s the strongest person I ever met.  But because of this I have never shared much of my personal life with her.  I try to open up more now, because I want an open relationship with her.  And, to her credit she has tried a lot harder to be less strict but she\\'s still her own way.\\n\\nWell because of this I have made it a point to involve my son in our lives as much as makes since given his age etc.  he has always been given a voice.\\n\\nOkay so let\\'s get the background over... I\\'m a single mother to a 5 year old boy with several allergies. Some severe and some mild.  Including an array of food allergies. My mother babysits him while I am at work.  This generally means she is feeding him about one meal a week by my request, and sometimes he gets junk or treats there too.\\n\\nWell recently my mom was feeding him and the other kids (cousins) some dinner which happened to be cooked with an ingredient my son is allergic to.  It\\'s complicated to explain the nature of that particular allergy but while he will likely not die from it, he is still usually caused a bit of discomfort when he eats it.  Hives, itchy mouth, etc.  Typically if it is cooked and he gets some, it\\'s okay. But he has reacted to cooked too. So even though his epipen isn\\'t for that specific food, we avoid it.  Basically he *can* eat it and not die but really shouldn\\'t and he and I have decided together he won\\'t. \\n\\nWell mom told him he had to eat his dinner or he was going to be in big trouble.  When he said no again she told him he was grounded from\\nScreens all night until he cleaned his plate.  My son\\'s reply was \"Fine. I don\\'t care how much trouble I\\'m in I am NOT eating that.  You can\\'t make me.\"\\n\\nWell of course my mom was livid when I got there to get him.  And she had told me he has to apologize before he can come back.\\n\\nI told her that I can\\'t make him do that. I have taught him from day 1 that he can refuse to eat any food he\\'s allergic to. No adult can make him poison himself. And I will 100% back that up.  \\n\\nNow mom is saying we are both AH\\'s and need to apologize to her.  That she knows which foods he is deathly allergic to and which ones are \"fine as long as he has antihistamines if he gets hives.\" \\n\\nSo, AITA? And was my son holey-jr? \\n',\n",

       " \"I'm a 28 y/o male and my immediate family is all women, mostly this is because I was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when I was young. My two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. \\n\\n\\nAbout 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. Originally this was to see one of the Magic Mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. Originally it didn't bother me, because I'm an adult and I have my own life, and my own house, and I really didn't even think about it. But an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. My aunt's birthday was in January and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. So I bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. \\n\\n\\nWhen I asked what was going on for her birthday, I was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. This kind of irked me because when I mentioned I bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. I felt pretty left out since I am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. \\n\\n\\nI griped about and was told that I was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. I agree with that, but once again, I'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was I was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when I asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. \\n\\nAt this point I was VERY annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. Nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so I decided I needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. So I removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my Facebook. Now my phone is being blown up and I'm being told that I'm immature and I need to grow up. I responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and I'm just going to follow that example. \\n\\n\\nAm I the asshole here? \",\n",

I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat ‚Äî just the aisle and window. \\n\\nWell, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. I assume maybe he bought two hence why he‚Äôs even attempting to board. I‚Äôm mentally crossing my fingers he‚Äôs not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. \\n\\nI get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him:\\n\\n‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôm sorry but this situation is not working for me, you‚Äôre taking up quite a bit of my seat‚Äù. \\n\\nHe wasn‚Äôt rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there‚Äôs not nothing he can do ‚Äî although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn‚Äôt enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I‚Äôm talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. \\n\\nI end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren‚Äôt any open seats on this flight, so there wasn‚Äôt a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence. \\n\\nThe guy seemed embarrassed and didn‚Äôt want to get up. He mentioned how he can‚Äôt wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight ‚Äî the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he‚Äôll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here‚Äôs where I made my offer. \\n\\nI told the guy, ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôll put up with this if you give me $150 ‚Äî that‚Äôs half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.‚Äù\\n\\nHe instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it. \\n\\nWell the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn‚Äôt volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. \\n\\nFrom my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person‚Äôs body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn‚Äôt angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. \\n\\nAfter the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but I ignored them.

On school nights she can stay at our house until 10:30, on weekends I‚Äôm fine with her being there from midnight-12:30. \\n\\nMy daughter recently came out as bisexual, and introduced us to her girlfriend. She asked if she could come over to the house Friday night, I said yes, but she had to leave by midnight, the same rule my sons girlfriend has to follow. \\n\\nMy daughter threw a fit saying it wasn‚Äôt fair she wasn‚Äôt allowed to stay because she is also a girl. That is not my issue. I know that teens will be teens, and they will have sex. I know my husband has provided condoms to our son, and I know that his girlfriend is on birth control. My rule about when girlfriends or boyfriends have to leave has nothing to do with sex, it‚Äôs just a rule that I had to follow as a teen, and I think it‚Äôs a good rule to have. \\n\\nMy daughter has not spoke to me since Friday night when I wouldn‚Äôt let her girlfriend stay the night, and I‚Äôm not sure what to feel. She thinks I‚Äôm the biggest Ahole around. \\n\\nSo reddit, AITA for not letting my daughters girlfriend stay the night? ',\n",

If she didn‚Äôt enjoy that, it‚Äôs just idk wrong.  \\n\\nShe cried when I said I don‚Äôt think I can have a relationship without sex.   Like sobbed.   She said that‚Äôs why she never told me. \\n\\nI asked her how she saw our relationship progressing.  She was really adamant that we could make it work.  That we could even have kids.   But as far as sex I could just get sex toys. \\n\\nA relationship with her on her terms really just sounds like friends with a kid.   I already have friends.   I don‚Äôt want to have a kid with them.   \\n\\nShe‚Äôs super emotional right now, I don‚Äôt know how to deal with it honestly.  Her friendship relationship doesn‚Äôt work for me. ',\n",
       " 'I was casually seeing this girl for about 2 months. She\\'s a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. I don\\'t date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it\\'s the same principle of \"don\\'t shit where you eat\". I don\\'t want the unnecessary drama.\\n2. I don\\'t date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. I want to date someone who likes me for me, not for the fact that I play football.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI didn\\'t want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don\\'t get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I\\'d rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn\\'t want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: Just to avoid confusion, its not about the fact that she\\'s slept around. It\\'s specifically WHO she has slept with. I don\\'t really care about partner count, I do care about having slept with my friends/teammates.',\n",
       " 'To start, I married into a large Mexican family and I am the only caucasian and American born woman in this entire family. My husband\\'s family only speak Spanish, which I am not fluent in or even close. I try to communicate with them all but I can only speak very simple sentences and I don\\'t understand most of what is being said to me. Belive me when I say I try to learn the language but it has been super hard for me to do so. Most of the family stop speaking to me once they realize I can\\'t understand the language and with that I cease to exist. My husband tries to include me but after a bit he gets caught up with his family and I am left to myself, usually in a corner on my phone. Eating is a big part of getting together and and I try to include myself in the preparation but I am always cast to the side because I am a \"gringa\" and some how that means I am unable to cook anything. Tonight dinner has been prepared and as usual I have been left out, I am used to it so I just stayed out of the way. Time had come to eat and the table isn\\'t large enough for everyone, seriously there is one chair and spot short, which means I am left out from eating. I was asked to wait until everyone was done and then I could eat. All the other wives are sitting with their husbands eating, talking and having a great family time. I am near tears, so I just got up and walked out and am now sitting in my car. I have refused to go back into the house to wait for my \"turn\" to eat, when my husband came out to get me. AITA for refusing to wait my turn to eat? Even though I\\'m sure everyone is wondering why I left and refuse to go back in.\\n\\nEdit: There is 20+ adults and as many children. \"Mama\" came out to get me and as she is the head of the family I went back in. Now get this...there was only a scoop or two of beans and rice left on the stove and a few tortillas. Now okay, I left and totally wasn\\'t expecting to come back in. Mama started taking food off of other people\\'s FINISHED plates for me to eat. And I\\'m sitting on the couch by myself with a plate of people\\'s food meant to be thrown away.

       " 'Right now, I\\'m seeing a woman in a fairly casual situation. I\\'m 27 years old and she\\'s 25, and the incident I\\'ll talk about happened on our third date.\\n\\nOn Saturday night we went to a gourmet burgers and fries place (think Pulp Fiction John Travolta/Uma Thurman car in the wall joint) for my birthday dinner. It was her choice and I thought it sounded like a grand idea, as corny restaurants are always a blast. A while after our burgers came the waitress paid us the typical \"how is everything\" visit, and stuck around for a short chat after. During the course of our talk I ended up mentioning that it was my birthday, and she told me that it was hers too. It was a nice little coincidence and we all seemed to get a kick out of it.\\n\\nEventually our waitress excused herself. After we finished eating we ordered a couple of shakes, at which point the waitress and I nicknamed each other \"birthday girl\" and \"birthday boy,\" respectively.\\n\\nOur check came, and to my surprise my date didn\\'t make any indication that she was going to pay. I didn\\'t raise a stink about it of course, and I didn\\'t think it was exactly a huge deal. I thought it was normally for the non-birthday party to pay on someone else\\'s birthday, but again, different people may be used to different things.\\n\\nI checked the bill and saw \"Happy Birthday!\" written at the bottom with a cute smiley face. I put in the cost of the meal with a standard tip, and we got up and put on our coats. At the last second I told my date to hold on a bit, opened the bill back up, and slipped in another $100. I wrote with the provided pen \"You too!\" next to her message. My date noticed this and gave me a sideways look.\\n\\nIn the car I asked what she wanted to do next, and she gave me the silent treatment, just kind of sighing and looking out the window. I figured it had something to do with the tip I gave the waitress because that\\'s when she started acting like that. I asked what was wrong and she just responded by settling deeper into the seat. The next few minutes were completely silent and I just started heading towards her house.\\n\\nShe abruptly blurted out a bit later that I was wasting my money and she couldn\\'t believe I was so irresponsible. I asked her what was wrong with giving $100 to our waitress for her great service, and she said that I should have spent the money elsewhere, or at least given it to a deserving charity. Again, I reiterated that I felt it wasn\\'t a big deal, and couldn\\'t get a decent answer out of her.\\n\\nI took her home and without a word she just stepped out of my car, walked to her front door, opened the door, and walked without even turning her head back. Last night she texted me saying that I overtipped the waitress and asked how I felt about giving the waitress $100 when I haven\\'t given her (my date) a single gift yet. I haven\\'t responded and it is kind of keeping me up. \\n',\n",

       " 'Howdy, y‚Äôall. \\n\\nSo about a year ago, these 3 gals moved into an apartment in our building. We actually moved from that unit, to another in the same building. The ended up pushing their move-in date a week earlier, and bringing their parents to make demands on their behalf, but were generally polite despite requiring we suddenly clean up a week early for them. \\n\\nSince then, they‚Äôve taken to ignoring us on the street. We‚Äôve all just tried to be neighborly, but have since given up wasting time on it. The building is in a more expensive part of town, quite ‚Äúunique,‚Äù and the rent is incredibly low. So ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù has become the motto for this dilapidated gem. Now, about the note...\\n\\nIt‚Äôs their first apartment. They‚Äôve had issues with taking out trash for nearly their entire time here. While there are cans on the roof, most of us just go ahead and take our trash down to the dumpster. The place is owned by an older couple, and having the husband drag our trash all the way downstairs is something we and other tenants would prefer to avoid. Besides, there‚Äôs much more important work to be done around the place. \\n\\nBut these gals can‚Äôt even be bothered to bring their trash outside. They just let it pile up outside their door, inside the building, and stink begins to fester. So the owner eventually hauls it all the way outside and downstairs himself. I found him doing this one day, fumed over it for the night, and we wrote a note the next morning. It read;\\n\\n>\\t‚ÄúLook-\\n    Leaving your garbage up here is *trashy*.

       " 'My (now ex) girlfriend (Anna) and I had been dating for about 5 months when our relationship started having too many pointless arguments. One day we had a discussion as to whether or not we should continue dating but we were both conflicted because we were still in love despite the recent problems. Because of this, we decided to take some time to think, and planned to meet later that week to make a final decision. \\n\\nOn the day we planned to meet, I called Anna to see when we could talk and she replied that she was going to a party to get drunk and probably wouldn\\'t meet with me that night. I asked her not to get drunk so that we could talk after the party, and she agreed. But sure enough, later that night she texted me saying that \"The guys at the party say I\\'m too drunk to talk to you.\"\\n\\nI called Anna and told her that I felt like she was standing me up, and that if I didn\\'t see her that night than we were done dating. She insisted we weren\\'t over yet and would talk another day, but continued to refuse to meet up. I told her we were done, said goodbye, and hung up.\\n\\nI didn\\'t hear from Anna the next day but that afternoon a mutual friend called me and told me Anna was \"super depressed and scared.\" And told me I should go to her house to check on her. I went because I still cared about Anna and I was worried about her. When I got there Anna was crying and started hugging me and kissing me and telling me how she still wanted to be with me. She never told me why she was so depressed but I could tell I was making her feel better so I spent the next few days with her. During that time, we hung out, had sex twice, and mostly just enjoyed each others company.\\n\\nDespite the fun we were having, the way she stood me up when we were supposed to talk really bothered me, so I finally insisted we talk about our relationship. During that talk, Anna never told me why she wouldn\\'t meet up that night, but eluded that something happened. At that point I bluntly asked if she had sex with someone that night, and she told me she did, but not until after our conversation on the phone. (She didn\\'t use protection either) I told her how hurtful that was to me, but that I wasn\\'t surprised because she cheated on her last boyfriend. (Which is true) She got very upset when I said that and insisted she wasn\\'t in the wrong for her actions. I understand that I ended things with her on the phone that night, but I feel like the way she acted like nothing happened when I saw her the following day, telling me she loved me and wanted to be with me, and having sex with me, was wildly inappropriate. Had I known that she had slept with someone else I certainly would not of spent the following week with her. She purposefully kept that a secret so as to not upset me and avoid making me not want to be with her. I ended everything with her after that. So, am I the asshole for feeling like I essentially got cheated on?',\n",

So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they\\'re not really fixing the problem and 2 I\\'m nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don\\'t really have a problem with vaping, it\\'s that they\\'re doing at the school to please their peers). I didn\\'t really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn\\'t really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven\\'t fully realized how the world works.

She was really gorgeous ,confident and free spirited. I loved how silly and bold she was, it was something that made her really unique in my book. \\nThis whole thing happened a month ago. I had a really, really big presentation and I got really tensed. I had the opportunity to invite my gf to the function, and so I did, on the condition that she would not embarrass me and not drink, because she had a habit of drinking a lot during such occasions and losing control. \\n\\nWell, turns out she made fun of me just because she thought it was hilarious. She burped loudly when I was talking to my co workers, and told about how I didn‚Äôt even have sex because of the stress. She proceeded to ask my coworkers if they could resist her body. They were obviously uncomfortable too. The presentation ultimately went horribly bad at first because she kept making stupid silly faces backstage, but then I just ignored her for the rest of the night and all went well.\\n\\nFirst thing I did when we sat in the car was saying I was breaking up with her that night, she told me she was just trying to lighten my mood. I refused to let her touch me then, and dropped her off to her building. She said she wasn‚Äôt going to go till we sorted out the issue, I just told her to get out.\\n Then I gave her a text message saying I was sorry for being rude to her but we weren‚Äôt compatible, and to just move on with her life.\\n\\nFast forward to today, I bumped into a friend of hers who said that I had been an asshole for her to break up with her for being ‚Äòsilly‚Äô at a gathering, and that no one could believe I turned out to be such a jerk.\\n\\nNow I am already seeing someone, but this interaction made me question if I had indeed been a jerk. An unbiased opinion would help.\\n\\nEDIT:I did shout get out at her to make her leave, since she just kept talking and talking.\\n\\nEdit 2: Each comment honestly helps me a lot , and while I personally cannot thank everyone of know, know that I geniunely mean it.

I picked them all the time, gave them to neighbors, the mailman, basically anyone who asks gets a handful. I am not stingy with my avocados. \\n\\nWell, I work early mornings and have to leave my house by 5 am. Couple of days ago I\\'m walking to my car and in my front yard is an old lady picking avocados from my tree! She has a pile of like 50 of them already picked and she had even brought one of those nice retractable poles with the fruit catcher at the end of it.  (It was a really nice one)\\nI was soooooo pissed I just walked right up to her and snatched it from her hand. She had a total \\'deer in the headlights\\' look, but once I grabbed the pole from her she starts yelling at me \\'hey! That\\'s mine!! That\\'s mine!\\' \\nSo I tossed it over our fence where our German Shepard was barking. (Good luck getting that back) \\n\\nThen i got right in her face and screamed \"Well those are my avocados now GET THE FUCK OFF MY YARD!!\".\\nI really scared her, I could see it in her face.

       " 'I met my husband when I was a junior in college, I was 21 and he was 23. I am currently 25 and he is 27. Before we dated I‚Äôve always told him that I was always afraid of having kids due to multiple reasons such as me being in college, I don‚Äôt have a steady financial income to raise a kid, I am the only one of my family that lives far away which means I don‚Äôt have a steady support system. \\n\\nI told him in the beginning I don‚Äôt want to have kids until I‚Äôm at least 25. He told me he understands and we started dating. I became madly in love with this man and everything about him over a year and a half of dating and he decided to propose to me. Of course I said yes. I finished college and We moved in together.\\n\\nThe day of our wedding night we had always used condoms to prevent me from being pregnant but since it was a special night for the both of us, we decided not to use one. I was hesitant at first but he convinced me and I followed along. The next morning I bothered him to grab me a plan B but he shook it off and told me, you won‚Äôt get pregnant , you won‚Äôt get pregnant I promise. I believed him but I was also worried. \\n\\nThe next coming month I‚Äôve had pains, stomach pains and I was late on my period. I was afraid I was pregnant and I took a test which confirmed I was. I waited for him to come home from work to tell him the news. I told him the news and he was just excited, he wasn‚Äôt in shock or nothing, he was just happy. Telling me how he‚Äôs going to be a father, how‚Äôs he going to be an amazing dad and so on.\\n\\nIn my mind I told him I didn‚Äôt want kids until I was at least 25 or we had a suitable financial life. I worked as a temp as a human resource assistant and he was a Tooling technician. We had enough to live together, to do the things we wanted to do together as a couple but not enough to raise another human being in my mind. \\n\\nI was so afraid of being pregnant I did what I thought was best. I couldn‚Äôt tell him because I didn‚Äôt want him to somehow convince me to have a kid I am not ready to have. I didn‚Äôt  want to have a kid I will regret or not ever wanted in the first place. I‚Äôve seen so many people who struggled like this, who think they will be okay to have a kid. Many do have an amazing life and they have an amazing family but I was scared of becoming the opposite of that. To be struggling, to be asking for help, to be a mom that is accused of being a bad mom, I wasn‚Äôt ready or prepared to be a mom in anyways. I knew he would just try to talk me out of it, so I went along with my secret and had the baby aborted without telling him. \\n\\nI didn‚Äôt realize the sadness he gave off when I told him the lie I had a miscarriage. I felt nothing but guilt. I told myself, just have a kid for him, have it for him. That‚Äôs when we tried again and again to find out he has been diagnosed with testicular cancer. ',\n",

Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn‚Äôt applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn‚Äôt say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples‚Äô leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn‚Äôt act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She‚Äôs annoyed at me.

They mostly say stupid stuff like \"This is Totally Wine,\" \"Live Laugh Love,\" and \"Strategic Planning Seminar \\'16.\" I have never heard or seen any rules about mug usage. For as long as I have worked here, mugs have been taken on a first-come, first-serve basis.\\xa0\\n\\nAll the mugs are washed at the end of the day, dried on a dishrack, and eventually put back in the cupboard.

Talking mad shit behind my back instead of face to face, like an adult. Calling me an annoying asshole and all sorts of other things I dont want to get into. The worst part is this is all AFTER I asked her if there's anything I can do/work on to make her more comfortable, nope she replies, all good. I get it that some people just want to complain so I let it go for a while, just ignoring it.\\n\\nWhat broke it for me was shes always alone up in her room drinking and listening to her shitty punk rock music by herself. She posts on her tumblr all the time about how shes sad and that all her friends are gone. I usually keep my distance because that's what she seems to prefer, but I texted her and asked her if shes okay and let her know that I'm a good listener if she ever wants to talk or whatever.\\n\\nSo she ignored my text and posted on tumblr that I'm so fucking annoying and I need to 'leave her alone and let her live her life' comparing me to her dad. LOL WHAT LIFE. From what I can tell all she does is sit up in her room and drink alone. Yeah I'm going to check into it to make sure you're not going to kill yourself or burn my house down. Who the fuck reacts that way when someone asks you if you're okay or need help?\\n\\nI've been nothing but kind to this girl because she seemed really lonely. I got her a space heater because my house is too cold for her. I got her a (used) bed from my parents for her birthday because she couldnt bring hers when she moved here. I'm quiet and respectful (I try anyway) and from where I'm sitting she just seems like a complete cunt.

What would you do in my place? Am I a creepy cyber stalker? Am I justified in trying to find out more because shes so reserved? Blowing this out of proportion? Any responses appreciated. \\n\\nTLDR: Roommate has no problems with me when asks, but complains non stop on tumblr about me saying hurtful things. I'm doing her a favor here and when I saw that I gave her 1 month to find a new spot.\\n\\nEDIT: before I kicked her out I warned her twice that I can see ever she posts and so can my friends, and that its embarrassing. And could she please make her profile private. That was too much to ask. Cue temper tantrum on tumblr about both myself and my girlfriend. I have no reason to do her any favors if that's how shes going to behave.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Alright in all honesty, everything I've posted is true except for the fact that I haven't actually told her to leave. I wouldnt realistically evict someone because they said some mean things about me on the internet. \\n\\nI'm sure shes looking for another place now anyway, but I'm not going to inconvenience her with a time frame like that. $600 is still $600 and she always pays on time. I just wanted to know what people would think if I had terminated our contract. Thanks for most responses, from the people who could respond civilly. \\n\\nEDIT 3: She told me about her tumblr on day one. She didnt show it to me but it wasnt some big secret. So for her to be upset that I found it and all the shitty things shes been posting just makes me think shes not too bright upstairs\",\n",
       " \"I (25) dated this girl (24), lets call her Betty, all throughout high school and our freshman year of college.  We tried making it work but I went out of state for college and she went to a school two hours from our hometown, we eventually called it quits. Five years is a long time to be invested in someone especially at such a young age. Which is one of the reasons we decided we should remain friends. Also our families had been good friends since Betty and I were in third grade so it was nearly impossible to completely cut ties. All in all it was a relatively healthy break up. \\n\\nFast forward about four years, Betty and I both graduated college. I stayed in the town I went to college to work while Betty decided to move back to our hometown to work. Betty had remained close with my family and would visit them often since she lived right in town. Our parents continued their weekly gamenights. Betty and I talked occasionally but mostly kept up with each others lives via Facebook.  \\n\\nThat same year Betty's mother (48F) passed away unexpectedly. My family was being extremly supportive and I was doing my best to support her from a thousand miles away. My father goes on business trips all around the United States. So a couple of months after Betty's mother passed away my father (45) decided it would help Betty if she went on a trip to NYC with him. My little sisters (12) went with them so nothing seemed out of the ordinary. When they got back everything seemed normal but about a month later is when everything came out. \\n\\nMy father decided that the best way to tell my mother (45) that he was divorcing her was to take her out to dinner with the pastor of their church and tell her in a public place. I think he did this intentionally so she didn't freak out at him when he told her he was leaving her for her son's twenty-four year old ex girlfriend. As soon as he told her, he left the resturant, went home to tell my sisters he was leaving then packed some clothes and left. He had admitted that his relationship with Betty had started almost a year prior to Betty's mother passing away. So no, he didn't take advantage of a grieving woman.   \\n\\nNow lets fast forward roughly eight months (nobody has seen or heard from my father since he left) I get a call from him. Turns out that Betty got pregnant on their trip to NYC and is due to give birth any day. My mind was blown, as if it wasn't bad enough that he was with Betty now he's starting a family with her. I couldn't even think of anything to say to him so I mumbled something about needed to take my dog for a walk and hung up the phone. \\n\\nNow I haven't spoken to my father since that day and that entire side of my family has quit talking to me. Including my own grandparents. Even the people from my hometown are supportive of my father and Betty's relationship. So am I the asshole?\",\n",

Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don\\'t despise my sister. It\\'s not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it\\'s best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue.

       " 'The title basically says it all. My sister and I are only a year apart and were raised the exact same way. Thing is, she‚Äôs a bit hippy-ish. Which is fine, but it‚Äôs gotten more extreme since she had kids. (I‚Äôm a mother of one myself, so I get how your beliefs can evolve when you become a parent‚Äìbut IMO she‚Äôs really out there on a lot of topics). \\n\\nEvery Sunday we try to get together at my parents‚Äô house and hang out, have dinner, etc. (We all live fairly close by and my parents are getting older so it‚Äôs been a nice little tradition). \\n\\nSo I guess my sister was doing a feeding in my parent‚Äôs room. I guess my mom didn‚Äôt know and so she walked in. I didn‚Äôt hear but she apparently said something to my sister about how she thought my nephew was getting weaned. They ended up getting into an argument about it. I (regrettably) went into the room see what was going on. My sister was raising her voice and, i thought, crossing some lines with how she was speaking to our mom. I got annoyed and I told my sister that she can‚Äôt expect everyone to be okay with her continuing to breastfeed and sleep with a kid who should be in kindergarten (she‚Äôs homeschooling him for now) and that it is a bit creepy. \\n\\nThat‚Äôs when she ended up calling me ignorant and taking my nephew (and my 7 y/o niece) and leaving. She didn‚Äôt even sitting down to eat dinner, unfortunately.\\n\\nOverall it was pretty awful. But everyone else (meaning my parents, brother, and sister-in-law) are took my side and said I just verbalized what everyone has been thinking. I still feel bad though because, I mean, she‚Äôs my sister. I‚Äôve texted her, but, predictably, no response yet. \\n\\nAnyway, I know this might be sensitive topic for some people (and I don‚Äôt feel like dealing with any drama, hence the throwaway).

She told me that she was allergic to vanilla so I apologized and said I would try to avoid wearing it but we rarely worked together anyway before.\\n\\nI wore it by accident a few times when our shifts overlapped and she was pretty dramatic and snippy about it and would make comments about being sick around me. It came out that she‚Äôs not actually allergic, she developed an aversion to the smell during a previous pregnancy years ago (which I do understand happens). I was a lot more sympathetic to the issue when she literally used the word ‚Äúallergic‚Äù but I also understand that it makes her feel nauseous to smell vanilla after her pregnancy.\\n\\nNow, as of about two weeks ago, we work together every day. We have the same schedule and same days off. When I told her I got full time her response before any kind of congratulations was to tell me that my ‚Äúvanilla days‚Äù were her days off (before knowing we had the same days off). I would have been completely okay with her pulling me aside and politely saying ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôve noticed you like to wear vanilla scented products and I just wanted to ask if you could please avoid it at work as I have an aversion from a pregnancy that makes me feel nauseous if I smell it‚Äù rather than being commanding and rude and dramatic from the get-go.\\n\\nTo be honest the way she‚Äôs been patronizing and telling me when I‚Äôm ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to wear vanilla rather than politely asking have made me want to double down on the vanilla and wear it harder.

Again, I‚Äôm talking vanilla scented lotion on my legs and arms applied 12 hours before shifts, not spraying myself down with sprays.\\n\\nThat said, I do understand that someone should not be made uncomfortable in their work place by being forced to smell a scent that makes them feel queasy.\\n\\nI genuinely don‚Äôt know the correct way to handle this. If she had been polite and respectful from the beginning I would be a lot more willing to make changes. In general she tends to be really patronizing and kind of rude to me, and I do have a bit of an inferiority/people pleaser complex so I can be bad at being assertive and standing up for myself. I do want her to understand that she‚Äôs speaking to another adult who is not inferior to her in any way.

He will also often want to wrestle with them (sometimes by surprise), which; because of his larger stature, ends up with him on top of them and touching them inappropriately (breasts as well as crotch) and saying sexually suggestive things  - He does this to my GF the most.\\n\\nWhat kind of annoys me is that most people will just play it off and say it\\'s ok for him to do it because he\\'s gay. IDK, it just really sounds Unkosher to me, especially because this is at school and he\\'s been doing it more since I told my GF I wasn\\'t very comfortable with him doing that stuff - at least to her right in front of me.\\n\\nIt now looks like he will purposefully go out of his way to touch her inappropriately right in-front of me, I really feel this way because he will intensely glare at me while doing it.\\n\\nIdk, I talked to another friend about it and she said that I needed to put my homophobic feelings away and let him be this way....

I confessed I did, and she told me that Most of the girls in the group were actually very uncomfortable with how Norman was acting and treating them. They were gonna go to the administration themselves weeks ago but, Plot twist, my GF pleaded they don\\'t - **Apparently she doesn\\'t really like his actions either** but didn\\'t want to see her best friend get kicked out or reprimanded for it in fear of him taking it out on her and unfriending her. J told me my GF had talked to them about how I felt, and when they told her what she was doing (not telling norman to stop) was disrespectful, she got very defensive of Norman - **Saying that apparently I\\'m just a big Homophobe that she would be dumping before she tells Norman to change** (apparently she told them that he should be allowed to express his sexuality however he wants)... She also apparently told him to do it more in front of me to annoy me/make me jealous...

When I first started dating bf he told me he didn‚Äôt like giving head because of a bad experience with a girl (smelly vag). I thought fair enough and didn‚Äôt want to push him into something he‚Äôs not comfortable with. Fast forward and in the two years we‚Äôve been together he‚Äôs gone down on me a total of 8 times. For a while there I actually forgot vaginal oral sex existed. Last week his friends were drunk and discussing how often they give head, which is almost always. I felt a bit bummed after hearing this, so asked bf the next day if there was something wrong with my lady bits and is that why he hardly ever does it. I keep things pretty clean and tidy down there and have never had any odour issues, so I figured maybe it doesn‚Äôt look normal and that‚Äôs why. He responded that he doesn‚Äôt even mind, he just doesn‚Äôt like doing it cause he ‚Äúgets nothing out of it‚Äù. Which is a damn far cry from his original excuse. This made me really angry. I go down on him all the time. I think he‚Äôs being extremely selfish. The whole point of oral is to pleasure your partner, you don‚Äôt get anything out of it but the enjoyment of getting them off. I‚Äôve been stressing out that somethings wrong with me or that he‚Äôs traumatised from a bad experience, but the whole time he just doesn‚Äôt want to do it because he‚Äôs selfish and only wants to do stuff that gets him off.

       " 'This morning my gf told me about this game on steam that\\'s coming out that\\'s about hurting women. Now I haven\\'t done much looking into it but it sounds like a messed up game to me and the creator is trying to push the boundaries of what\\'s okay to make and put on steam. So naturally my gf asked me to stop supporting a company that allows a game like this to be sold, my response as intelligent as it was was just \"but how will I play my games?\". I don\\'t support this game or the content depicted in it but I don\\'t feel like I should stop using steam cause steam is letting it be sold on the platform. What do you guys think?\\n\\n:EDIT: Thank you all for giving your point of views. She did at first come on very strong about this and I should stop supporting steam, it was only cause the situations depicted to close to home for her but we did have a peaceful conversation about it, I also explained a few things to her about steam and such which calmed it down some. She definitely feels steam should play a bigger roll as to what\\'s posted for games tho the whole hands free thing bothers her I guess. As it stands now tho the issue is resolved and she isn\\'t bothering me about playing on steam anymore. I also am getting a and giving a happy ending to this. ;)',\n",
       " \"I've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \\n\\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \\n\\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \\n\\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\\n\\nEdit: guitar is fucking fake. I called them when the dude on here shared the link tp see if I could get an appraiser and they said they‚Äôve been trying to call me for a few days. I just talked with the music store that sold it to me and they say an employee mislabeled it and put it online when they shouldn‚Äôt have, they are refunding my money including shipping. That was a roller coaster of a day. Wow. Nothing lost I guess \",\n",

       " \"My wife and I were taking an early morning flight out for a mini vacation.  As we were about to sit at our assigned seats, we saw a service member in uniform sitting in my wife‚Äôs window seat (I had the middle).  Since it was the first flight out, we wanted to get a little sleep, but my wife really can‚Äôt sleep on a plan unless she‚Äôs at the window.  Plus, we paid around $600.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs we approached our seats, he was already snuggled in the seat as if he was also going to get some sleep as well.  When I asked if he was in the correct seat (even though I knew he wasn‚Äôt), he said, ‚ÄúDo you mind if I just sit here?‚Äù with a very smug look on his face.  It was as if he assumed I would say yes.  I kindly said no.  He then replied, ‚ÄúAre you sure? You can have the aisle.‚Äù  I turned to my wife to see what she thought, and she shook her head to say no.  So again, I said no thanks.  After that I heard a couple of other passengers say to just let him sit there.  He just stared at me after that and still didn‚Äôt move.  Maybe he was expecting that I would give in after hearing those comments.  I then sternly asked him to please sit in his assigned seat.  He finally complied but was obviously annoyed.  I overhead those other passengers saying I should‚Äôve let him sit there.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI feel as if he was using the fact that he was in the military to his advantage by the way he responded.  I can only assumed he has done this before since he was so smug.  However, maybe he was finally coming home after some time away from home and was tired.  I felt a little guilty, but also couldn‚Äôt forget how smug he was.  Also, I fly quite a bit for work and have never had anyone defend someone else who was sitting in the wrong seat.  I assume it was because he was in the military.  Anyway, AITA?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: I'm pretty sure he was Army since we were flying out of SeaTac and JBLM is close.  There were several other uniformed service members on the flight.  He didn't look young enough to be fresh out of boot camp.  I think maybe he was 20.  I don't know what rank he was.  I'm not familiar with how to identify that.  And for the people who think this story is fake, I forgot to mention that everyone on the plane, including the pilots, stood up from their seats and clapped once he moved seats.\\n\\n&#x200B;\",\n",
       " '\\n\\nFinal edit. Please read.\\n\\n\\nI will come clean. This is a shitpost due to one key factor: I am not the father. I am the daughter. \\n\\n\\nMany of you called this in the comments but it‚Äôs true. I tried to give his perspective in a honest way and embody the belief system he truly has.\\n\\nThere is only one lie in this story overall: I have not left and I have no plans to leave. I can‚Äôt afford it, not even for university. \\n\\nI suppose there is one other lie: my dad doesn‚Äôt want to change, he doesn‚Äôt want counselling for his PTSD and he doesn‚Äôt want me to be happy.\\n\\nI am sorry for lying. I just wanted some perspective based on my dad telling the story; the way others see it. \\n\\nMy friends have told me this is normal, my mum, my family. \\n\\nSo I did. It is only when I found reddit that I thought different. \\n\\nI wasn‚Äôt ‚Äògullible‚Äô or ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô for not liking his jokes. I was just a normal person.\\n\\nAgain, I am sorry for the shitpost. I am still in counselling but my dad doesn‚Äôt know about it and he doesn‚Äôt care to know. \\n\\nI will delete this now, since it is a shitpost. \\n\\nWell done for calling it in comments but still: I tried to make my dad as likeable and witty as I could. The way others see him in real life and I quoted him verbatim in response to some comments. \\n\\n‚ÄòMy daughter isn‚Äôt fat, but she WAS‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòI want to make her happy‚Äô\\n\\nMy mum won‚Äôt divorce him, she is too scared as was fore-mentioned because, well here is the third lie and the final one. I cut out the fact he has hit us on occasion beyond ‚Äòsmacking‚Äô when I was a kid because that‚Äôs what my dad would say. He would deny it.\\n\\nThank you for reading and I apologise for the lies. \\n\\nThank you for the advice. I wish my dad was different, I wish he wanted to change. I wish he would get counselling, \\n\\nBut he won‚Äôt. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n....\\n\\nOriginal post-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThrowaway, for reasons.\\n\\nI‚Äôm 56 years old and my daughter is 17\\n\\nThe daughter and I have had a few issues throughout the years which started in her teens, as most father-daughter problems do.\\n\\nWhen she was little, she was a little chubby so I used to call her chubster, pudge, etc, as a joke and talk to her about the importance of losing weight. When I was growing up, my dad would often call me fat and to keep fat, which inspired me to lose weight and get fit. \\n\\nAnyway, when she got to her teens, she started being a bit funny about being eating, (making herself sick, etc). She wasn‚Äôt anorexic though as she wasn‚Äôt skinny enough. Anyway, we started having arguments and the revolving subject of those tiffs would be how I made her feel ‚Äòunworthy‚Äô and ‚Äòfat‚Äô. She also keeps bringing up this occasion where I apparently called her fat in public at age eight, making her cry and telling her, ‚Äògo eat a chocolate bar, that will make you feel better, fatty‚Äô. This is an event I cannot remember but my wife remembers clearly. \\n\\nThis has caused a significant rift between my daughter and I and on many occasions she has used the silent treatment on me. I‚Äôm talking weeks of silence, only speaking to the wife. It makes it unbearable. \\n\\nWe usually have a slightly jokey relationship when we are friendly, however the banter sometimes becomes a little bit personal. She will call me fat etc and I will in return. Sometimes, it‚Äôs ok and sometimes it‚Äôs not. I just don‚Äôt know where I stand. \\n\\nAnyway, in one event in question, she called me a ‚Äòcock‚Äô so I said she had a big nose. It was all friendly but immediately, after I said that, she went cold on me. Turns out, or so my wife tells me, she hates her nose which is sort of Roman-esque but nothing huge or anything. It‚Äôs one of her ‚Äòbig insecurities‚Äô. She didn‚Äôt speak to me for about a week and is still cool with me now. \\n\\nAnyway reddit, am I the asshole for taking banter too far? \\n\\n\\n\\n....\\n\\nEDIT \\n\\nI spoke to my wife, she told me to leave it. She said my daughter has been talking about moving out because of my behaviour. She told me some other things about my daughter too. \\n\\nBut I still think I should speak to her. I feel so fucking bad about what I have said to her in the past but I don‚Äôt want to come across as disingenuous.  \\n\\n\\nEdit 2\\n\\nI spoke to her. It didn‚Äôt go well. At all. \\n\\n\\nUpdate\\n\\nShe went to her grandparents last night and this morning she came back. We had a long talk about things. I told her about this post. She was pissed at me understandably for airing out our dirty laundry in public but she later told me she has made a few posts on r/raisedbynarcissists and r/amitheasshole about the situation between us. She said it was fine that I have this post up by the end and she said thank you for the advice (to all the responders). She told me a list of things I have said in the past that have made her feel like shit:\\n\\n1. Weight comments\\n2.Nose comments\\n3. Jokingly called her stupid etc, made her feel insecure about her intellect\\n4. Lazy, made her feel as though she was going to fail school\\n5. Acne, etc\\n\\nAnd many more. \\n\\nShe has told me she can‚Äôt forgive me for what I have said but she wants to find a solution for the wife‚Äôs sake. She said she loves me but she doesn‚Äôt want to live in the same house. I understand this completely.\\n\\nAlso, as some other comments have suggested, I should reach out to my son. \\n\\nHe owes me around thirty thousand dollars due to his drug use and had two children by a girl who was fifteen at the time of conception. I have said things to him in the past that I regret and, to buy his affection, I supplied his drug use. \\n\\nI need to make a change in my life. \\n\\nThis will not end well. ',\n",

Until, two weekends ago, my wife‚Äôs friend came over and they were in the kitchen which is open to the living room where I was, talking about taking the friends daughter shopping for a prom dress. My wife says ‚ÄúI still have my prom dress, let me get it and show it to you.‚Äù She returned with the dress and she showed it to her friend and her friend made a comment ‚Äúoh, no, it has spots on it‚Äù and my wife says ‚Äúoh, yeah, my date made a mess!

But it soon became pretty obvious that she did not have feeling for john and they were just friends. Jane is a very awesome person and became part of our friend group. I would say that jane and I are friends although we never hung out without being with a group of people.

Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \\n\\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \",\n",
       " \"About a month ago my wife asked me if I'm ever willing to try an open relationship. We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She even had a plan of action of how this would go out and mentioned that he would be into it too. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \\n\\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \\n\\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \\n\\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after her coworker enough to want an open relationship? \\n\\nUpdate/edit: So we sat down and spoke for a while. I asked her if there was anything about me that she was unhappy with. She immediately said that she made a mistake and realized it after looking at her friend's horrified reaction when she told her about our fight. She said she hasn't regretted anything more in her life than this and feels bad that I've been miserable and basically torturing myself. I told her I'll never stop loving her: my problem was never about our love. I know she loves me more than anything. But I just need some space for now. I was exhausted and miserable and told her if she wants to be with this other guy then she should. I'm not going to divorce her over this. She broke down in tears because I've basically given up on us. I guess I'll be staying somewhere for a while till we speak with some 3rd party mediator. \",\n",
       " \"My parents have announced to my sister and I they are selling the family house to go into early retirement. It's something I'm a bit upset about, my sister kind of is but won't directly say it as she's worried she'll appear ungrateful. I haven't said anything to my parents about being upset and probably won't as I doubt I'll be able to change their mind and don't want to ruin our relationship.\\n\\nFor ages, I'm 30, my sister is 26 and my parents are 60.\\n\\nSome background as to why I'm upset. My parents are reasonably well off, solid middle class, not upper or lower. They bought their house when they were a couple of years younger than me and got significant support from my grandparents on my mom's side to do it. They didn't really need that support and used the money they saved to do a bunch of traveling around the world. My Grandparent's told me if I went through university (which I did) they would do the same for me and help my buy a house, my mom knew about this and mentioned it as an incentive to do uni. My cousins were also told the same thing. \\n\\nUnfortunately my grandparents passed away while I was studying and my mom and her sister got all the inheritence, my grandparents didn't leave a will. My Aunt used that to support my cousins in buying their houses, my parents used it to renovate their house. When I asked whether I would get the same support as my cousins my mom shut it down and said it was her inheritance and she could choose what she wants to do with it.\\n\\nMy parents didn't support myself or my sister in purchasing a house at all, and unfortunately house prices in my country have exploded so my current house is significantly worse than what my parents bought 35 years ago at 20x the price, same for my sister. \\n\\nOur family home was in a town that become a resort town so property prices boomed, both my sister and I had to move away. We were hoping one day we would inherit the house like my parents inherited their grandparents and use it as a family holiday house that my sister and I could take our children to.\\n\\nInstead my parents are selling so they can move into one of those pricey retirement resorts, they'll likely burn through their money and leave nothing to my sister and I. Having researched the place it's even likely that once they run out of money they'll be evicted and my sister and I will have to pay for an actual retirement home in their old age.\\n\\nI guess I'm upset because they aren't giving my sister and I the same advantages they got from their parents, it feels like they are taking for granted what they got and think we don't need it.\\n\\nTLDR; Parents are selling their house to retire early to a fancy retirement resort, got a load of money from their parents/my grandparents that got them to this in the first place and aren't passing anything along to my sister and I.\\n\\nEDIT: Since people aren't reading it: Grandparents said they would help my sister and I buy houses, passed away before they could, parents used their inheritance on renovations and travel and didn't help us, my Aunt used hers to help her children (cousins) buy houses. Aunt has expressed disappointment to me about what my parents did.\",\n",
       " 'I am a librarian at a prek-12 school. I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\\n\\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It\\'s not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don\\'t realize what they\\'re doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don\\'t get mad, because they\\'re little and they don\\'t understand that they\\'re doing something wrong.\\n\\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\\n\\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn\\'t react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn\\'t realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there\\'s a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn\\'t treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn\\'t deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\\n\\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn\\'t budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\\n\\nEdit: thanks for your responses everyone, especially those of you PMing me telling me to kill myself or that I‚Äôm an emotional bitch who should listen to the logical men or I will die alone :)))))) love u all',\n",
       " \"Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/b00iqa/_/\\n\\nSo this all went down last night, I'll try to include most details.\\n\\nI've been together with my girlfriend for 3 months right now (We're both 22 btw). I can honestly say I've never met someone who I have so much chemistry with, and we are extremely happy together. She's very intelligent and attractive, and we share a lot of interests. I met her at a bar and she actually came onto me, something that surprised me very positively. \\n\\nLast night we were talking and the topic of sex came up. We see each other 3 or 4 times a week and when we do we usually sleep with each other. She asked me how many people I slept with before her, and I told her I only hooked up with my previous girlfriend. Now I wasn't really thinking but naturally I asked her the same thing. She was a bit hesitant, so I told her she didn't need to tell me but that I wouldn't really care anyways. Well, this is where it starts to go downhill.\\n\\nShe told me that when she was 20 she worked as an escort for 2 months before quitting. She was with some high-end agency and slept with 2 or 3 guys a week and made quite some money. She stopped because she didn't like the work and made enough money to pay off some debt she had at the time. I was kind of stunned, I didn't really know how to react. When she was telling all this she seemed pretty cool, but when she saw my reaction she became pretty emotional. I told her I didn't expect it at all, and that I needed some time to think. I did hold her for a few minutes and she cried a little bit, but I left after some time.\\n\\nApparently I am much less open-minded as I thought I was. I really don't know how to feel about her past and it makes me feel kinda shitty. Later that night I got a long text from her and she told me that she loves me for the first time and that she hopes we can move past this. I replied that I loved her too but that I needed some time. After her message I also received a message from her friend saying she had never seen her as happy as with me and never as devastated as right now. She told me that I'm an asshole for leaving her like this and that I should man up. \\n\\nI get where she's coming from, but I don't agree with her. This is quite the revelation for me and I feel very conflicted.  Am I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the insights. I'm going to go over to her house in an hour or so, I will update later.\\n\\n\\nUpdate: We're going on a break. I went over to her place to talk and she was still very emotional. I asked her if there was anything else I should know that she hasn't told me. She confessed that she worked as an escort for almost 5 months instead of 2, and that she had kinda expected my response so she tried to downplay it. \\n\\nI'm not cool with lying, and I got pretty upset. It ended with an argument and her begging me to stay, but I left. Didn't get the chance to have a conversation. Haven't responded to any of her calls or messages. I don't know why she wouldn't just tell me the truth, makes me wonder what else she's hiding from me. I think that it's over. I'll sit down with her this weekend one more time and see where that goes. Cheers.\",\n",
       " 'Throwaway for obvious reasons. \\n\\n\\nAnyways the poor thing ended up contracting measles due to my sisters obvious negligence...Anyways his hospital bills are like 8 thousand dollars and now she‚Äôs requesting help from the family to help cover the cost of his 3 week hospitalization. I am pro vaccination as you can tell and make enough money . I could honestly reasonably give 2 thousand..But the crux of it is I don‚Äôt want to ? \\n\\nWhy should I have to donate money to some one who could have just gotten the vaccine and saved herself the trouble..The thing is if he had the vaccine and ended  up contracting it. I would have no problem giving her the money. She decided not to vaccinate knowing that she could never reasonable afford the bill. Why should our family have to pay when she made a bad choice?  \\n\\nAlso I‚Äôve done a lot for her in the sense of prepping meals and cleaning her house and caring for her dogs. It seems spiteful but I think she should have to suffer the consequences of her actions. So am I the asshole for refusing to give her money because I feel she was negligent by not vaccinating her son of the first place?  \\n\\n\\nEDIT:How dare people say I don‚Äôt love my nephew because I refuse to reinforce my sisters shitty behaviour. He is treated and recovering at home I have paid for a tutor as well as groceries and gas. I simply refuse to help her pay the medical bills as she will not vaccinate even though my nephew almost died...If she were to vaccinate and I watched the doctor do it I would pay the entire bill honestly. He‚Äôs also in soccer and hockey and I pay for that as well! Sorry if I wasn‚Äôt clear in that post also I have tried social services but regardless of the vaccination issue they can‚Äôt really make a case.  \\n\\n\\nEdit: I‚Äôm going to give social services a call with all my evidence and screen shots of our conversations where‚Äôs she‚Äôs being negligent I‚Äôm going to make a solid case and try for custody.

I‚Äôm so grateful for all the help this post has provided me. Hopefully I can build enough of a case against her I‚Äôve tried making calls before but her best friend is willing to help me so hopefully I can take him on and get him the help he needs. Im scared for him after the pox party thing and I feel it‚Äôs gotten out of hand. I‚Äôm not sure what the best route was but this post brought to my attention just how fucked up and dangerous this situation can be so I‚Äôm extremely grateful and I‚Äôm hoping and praying I can build enough of a case with CPS. Feeling like a bit of a dick because she genuinely thinks she‚Äôs doing what‚Äôs best but I love him and I fear for his safety! \\nIt‚Äôs not just this either my sister in not a fit parent in a TON of other ways. She has a mild drug problem and has ongoing multiple affairs with strange men...That are creepy and not meant to be around small children. \\n\\nAlso to clarify he‚Äôs out of the hospital and at home finishing his recovery he‚Äôs already been treated.

       " 'So I was recently having lunch with a friend and we had decided to try a restaurant that neither of us had been to.  We had reserved a table but when we arrived, the waitress took us to a 4 person table. I told her that we only had made a reservation for 2 people, she said that this was the only table that they had available for us. \\n\\nThe table was a small rectangular table, with 2 chairs on each of the longer sides, with one of the shorter sides against a wall. We sat facing one another, leaving an empty chair next to us on either side. \\n\\nAnyway, about half way into our meal, the waitress comes up to us with 2 other people behind her and asks us if we wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing our table with these 2 other people. \\n\\nAt first I was a bit taken aback, and really felt obliged to say ‚Äòyes‚Äô because she was standing there with these 2 other customers. But my thinking was that we had made a reservation, we hadn‚Äôt been told that this table would require us to share, we were already into our meals and no effort was made to discreetly inform us of this request or explain the situation. So I said (as politely as possible) that we were in the middle of our meal and would prefer not to share the table. I know this was taking a stand, but my view was that she had made no effort to be fair to us in this situation so why should I bend over backwards and ruin our meal by sharing a small 4 person table with 2 other strangers.\\n\\nThe waitress looked at me as if I had been incredibly rude and then proceeded to apologise to the other 2 people right in front of me saying something like: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so sorry but unfortunately they are unwilling to share their table we will have to find another place for you. I‚Äôm so sorry for the inconvenience‚Äô  (this was despite the fact that they had clearly heard me and were a little uncomfortable with the situation themselves). \\n\\nAfter this whole debacle, we were treated quite poorly by the waitress (she didn‚Äôt top up the water, took a long time getting the cheque etc).\\n\\nAfterwards my friend told me that I should have just agreed to share the table and shouldn‚Äôt have been so un-accommodating. But the way I see it, we should not have been put in this position by the waitress. If they had a policy of sharing tables (regardless of whether or not someone has made a reservation), then we should have been warned before we sat down.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for pushing back on the waitress‚Äô request and refusing to share our table?\\n\\nTLDR\\nWe had a reservation for 2 people at a restaurant, but were sat at a small 4 person table when we arrived. Half way through our meal, a waitress interrupted our meal (with 2 other customers)  and asked us if we could share our table - without any explanation as to why we were being asked. I politely said that we were half way through our meal and would prefer not to share. This was not taken well by the waitress and we were treated rather coldly after this encounter.\\n\\nEDIT: spelling ',\n",

       " 'This happened over the weekend and I feel pretty bad about how it went down, but my intentions were honorable here. I was the Best Man at my pal\\'s wedding. \\n\\nI got the idea to start up a bet and collect a pool from other people attending the wedding. The basic idea is that participants guess a year in which the couple will divorce and put in a certain amount of money (minimum bet $50), and IF they end up divorcing during that year whoever guessed that year wins the whole pot. \\n\\nSo for example, if 2 people guesses the year 2025, if the couple actually divorces in 2025, those 2 people would split the whole pot. (We raised a little over 3 grand total, so like $1500 each in this example.) \\n\\nBUT, if the couple is still married after the latest bet in the pool (somebody put 2040) then the couple gets the entire pot. \\n\\nSo that was kind of the twist that I meant to convey to them, that yeah sure it was a real bet, but that if they stayed together they could expect 3 grand in 2041. \\n\\nWhen I was explaining the bet during my best man speech that was how I was going to end, kind of with a charming/corny line that \"But we all know none of us are going to be winning the bet, because you two will be together forever, so you can look forward to cashing in in 2041!\" \\n\\nYes, if they actually divorced and if somebody in the betting pool nailed the right year we would follow up and that person would get the winnings. But I don\\'t think these two will get divorced, they\\'re perfect for each other. \\n\\nThat was supposed to be my intended message, it was supposed to be a kind of fun silly thing. \\n\\nBefore I could even get to that part the bride started crying and the parents and bridesmaids and all that were almost yelling at me, and the groom (my best friend of decades) was furious. \\n\\nEven later that night when I explained to him my intent he wouldn\\'t even listen to me. The bride especially apparently \"feels betrayed by everyone\" who participated in the bet. Even though I explained that I had misled all of them by saying the bride and groom knew about it in advance that wouldn\\'t make them less angry. \\n\\nSo needless to say I feel extremely bad. But I meant it all as a nice gesture and I feel if they could just see they have a near certainty of getting a free 3 grand in 2041 they could see this intention. I think by then it will be a fond memory and a \"look back on it laugh\" kind of thing when we get to the 2040\\'s, plus a nice little bonus of a 3 grand prize. \\n\\nI keep trying to explain this but my friend isn\\'t hearing it, especially when I told him that I still had to follow up with whoever \"wins\" on the off-chance they do get divorced. But I really doubt they\\'d ever get divorced. \\n\\nI know I went about it the wrong way but I don\\'t feel I was the A here, but I want to see what reddit thinks. \\n\\ntl;dr - Collected bets to see what year my friends would divorce at their wedding, but if they don\\'t get divorced they win, I meant it to be nice/sweet but they are both furious at me.

       " 'I made an ALT account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.\\nI‚Äôm also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so I‚Äôll try to keep it as PG as I can.\\n\\nSo, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)\\nI will say that she‚Äôs the first thin person I‚Äôve ever been with. She‚Äôs flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I‚Äôve been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I‚Äôve always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.\\nThis all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She‚Äôs always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she‚Äôs not attractive if she doesn‚Äôt have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.\\nI told her I had to be honest, and said that I‚Äôm not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It‚Äôs not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I‚Äôm being honest, that‚Äôs why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.\\nShe was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we‚Äôve been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn‚Äôt know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).\\n\\nAm I being the asshole here?\\n\\nEDIT:\\nHere‚Äôs an update, for people who wanted it.

       " 'I\\'m back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here\\'s my update.\\n\\nWell, since that day I made the post i\\'ve been staying with my grandfather. The week\\'s been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i\\'ll try to run it down.\\n\\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don\\'t feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn\\'t end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn\\'t exist.\\n\\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i\\'ve felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i\\'ve lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\\n\\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won\\'t lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\\n\\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I\\'m not going back. Later today i\\'m going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i\\'m planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\\n\\nI won\\'t be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i\\'ve learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don\\'t hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\\n\\nSo, there\\'s my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I\\'ll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it\\'s kinda cliche and i\\'ve said it a thousand times but thank you all. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it\\'s at my grandpa\\'s house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThank you all for the advice and love. It\\'s been amazing and i\\'m glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don\\'t know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i\\'ll maybe come around again. But for now I\\'m going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy\\'s :)',\n",

I got there before her, and went to a table. About five minutes later she comes.

It\\'s Melissa\" I kinda nervously said \"hey..\" in a confused way.

Nope.\\n\\nShe said \"This is Mike, he\\'s my son!\" I was shocked. I just looked at her and she said \"Yea, hes my bundle of joy. Had him at 18\" I said \"Are you serious?\" and she was like \"Yea!!

       " 'I have been dating my girlfriend Laura for about two years now.  Laura had always told me she was an atheist.  I am as well so it was pretty easy to just not have any religious discussions at home.  Well a couple months ago Laura started going to church services with her friend Sarah.  Sarah is a friend of Laura\\'s from childhood and their difference in religious beliefs had always been a point of friction, but Laura had wanted to ease that friction by going to a few services with Sarah.\\n\\nWell after a couple weeks I notice a pretty drastic change in Laura.  She started to reference god more often and even had a bible in her nightstand.  She got a cross necklace and started to not only go to Sunday services, but to some events the church held during the week with Sarah.  Again all of this was fine with me.  I basically had Sunday mornings to myself in the house so I could play games and do whatever.  \\n\\nThe issue came when Sarah made some comment one Sunday morning about how I need to come with them.  I politely declined (I\\'d been turning down church invites from my super religious family for years so its a reflex at this point.)  They left, but later that night Laura and I were talking and she started pressuring me to go to church with her and Sarah.  I\\'d been through conversations like this before (again my upbringing) and I made it clear to her that while I have no problem with her newfound faith I would not be sharing in it.  She gave up but was very cold toward me for a few days before she apologized and we made up.\\n\\nWell a few weeks later Sarah asks me again and I give her a polite but firm no as this is starting to annoy me.  Laura came back from church and seemed in a really good mood.  She made me my favorite meal and we talked about her day and it was nice.  Then abruptly she started weeping and telling me how she was terrified of me spending an eternity in hell and how I need to find god like she did because she didn\\'t want to lose me to Satan.  At this point I was fed up with it.  I didn\\'t escape my abusive religious family just to have it happen to me all over again.  \\n\\nLaura has been cold with me ever since and every time I try to talk to her she says \"there is nothing to discuss until you are willing to go to church.\"  So at this point I think I might just need to break up with her.  I feel bad because if we break up I am moving out.  I am not on the lease so Laura will be stuck paying in full for her place without me, but I cannot stand the idea of living with her after we break up.

       " \"Okay. Throwaway account. \\n\\nI am a 23 year old female. I have been in a relationship with 25m for over 5 years, living together for 2. A week ago, I found out that I was pregnant. Trust me when I say, we were being as safe as possible and it was a HUGE shock to us. We both talked and agreed that abortion is the best answer. \\n\\nSo, we made an appointment with the doctor. We have a mandatory reflection period after the first appointment and before the procedure. My next appointment is 3 days from today. \\n\\nSo, last friday, I started feeling overwhelmed at work and was kinda losing it in the bathroom when a coworker walked in. She is really sweet and one of the senior managers who helped me out a lot in the beginning. I spilled my beans and she was very comforting and calming me. But later that day, she asks me if I was willing to have the baby, so that she and her husband can adopt. Turns out both her and her husband have fertility issues and there was no way to get pregnant and they have been adopt for a long time now. She said she will help me with the pregnancy, help with the cost, put in a good word with boss at work so my career won't be affected etc etc. \\n\\nI was really shocked and said I will think about it. After thinking about it over the weekend, I decided that I didn't wanna do this. I was already feeling too overwhelmed and I didn't want to carry a baby only to give him/her up. I don't think I can handle that. \\n\\nSo, on Monday, I went to her office and told her about my decision. As soon as I said no, she started crying and I just felt so guilty. Because she is a sweet person and would be a lovely mother. I kept trying to explain to her and she wasn't willing to listen and she kept telling me to get out. I thought she needed a moment and left. But after that, she refused to hear my apology or even listen to my reasoning. She was  avoiding me all day. Some of my colleagues came to know about this and everyone was coming over to my desk to change my mind. I was almost breaking down and I kept saying no. Everyone thinks I am the asshole for preferring abortion when there is a good family willing to adopt. \\n\\nNeedless to say I was quite upset when I got home. When I told my bf about this, he didn't think I was the asshole but he did say this was a good idea and he would prefer this over abortion and he asked me to think about this for some more time and to postpone my appointment to Monday. But I said no, and that i am going to this appointment and that its final. \\n\\nThen he got mad and said that I wasn't even willing to think about it and that was the least I could do. He was also mad that I wasn't even willing to take his advice and that the baby is also his. I just went to the study room and locked the door and didn't talk to him after that. And also, I took WFH today because I didn't want to face anyone right now. I haven't spoken to anyone since last night.\\n\\nThis whole week has been an emotional rollercoaster.\\n\\nSo, AITA?? \\n\\nEdits:\\n\\nFirst of all, thank you for all support. Esp people who DMed me with personal stories and words of comfort. \\n\\n2. To the people who are DM'ing me with horrendous links and abuses.. please stop. It is already hard enough for me. \\n\\n3. For all the pro-life people here. Your main argument is that the baby is another life and my bodily anatomy doesn't matter because there is a person's life at stake. You do realise that if a person doesn't consent to organ donation before death, his organs will not be harvested despite the several lives which can be saved. Why? Bodily autonamy. A corpse's bodily autonamy is respected despite the several lives which are at stake while a woman's bodily autonamy is not being respected over a bunch of cells (one life, if a person is very far along the pregnancy). Just something for you to think about. \\n\\nLastly, I am sorry I couldn't respond personally to everyone. But I have read most, if not all comments here. And know that I am deeply thankful for everyone taking time to help me.\\n\\nEdit: spelling mistake. \",\n",

She pretty much burst into tears the moment I arrived. Lots of sorrys until she pulled herself together and I really nearly bolted bc I felt so awkward. \\n\\nGabby was the one to suggest Alice use her pictures. Alice showed me her phone and... it was a picture of her from a few months ago and she swiped through and there were more pictures, ones she said she was gonna put on Tinder. All of herself... and she was bigger. \\n\\nI feel really fucking dumb. Still. Alice has been losing weight over this last year (down over 100 pounds!!!) and didn\\'t have any flattering pictures bc she\\'s continuing her diet and shredding weight off and her and her sister didn\\'t know how to portray that on Tinder without scaring everyone off. So that\\'s why Gabby suggested she use her pics bc they believe Alice will look like her soon (tho she has probably several months to go before she\\'s close if I\\'m being honest, not that I care. Never did just thought I was being lied to).\\n\\nWhen I sent the screenshot, she panicked and blocked me out of embarrassment/shame and it took a talking from her sis to meet me and come clean.

       " 'I‚Äôm a white gay male in the United States. I was in class at college, and we were discussing the power of words in cultures, particularly in minority cultures.\\n\\nWhile we were all discussing the word ‚Äòbitch‚Äô, a black female classmate voiced her frustration with ‚Äúgay guys calling girls ‚Äòbitch‚Äô, and because the guy is gay, that makes it okay?‚Äù She went on to say that if a gay guy casually calls her bitch (context of something like, ‚Äúbitch, please...‚Äù), that she would then see it as okay to say similar things to him, except with the word ‚Äúfaggot‚Äù. \\n\\nI personally do not believe in the concept of ‚Äútaking the power away from words‚Äù by limiting its acceptable use to the group of people who were oppressed by its use against them in the past. I personally detest hearing other gay men calling one another ‚Äòhomo‚Äô or ‚Äòqueer‚Äô in a casual way like that (I have maybe once or twice EVER heard the words ‚Äòfag‚Äô or ‚Äòfaggot‚Äô used that way). I believe a group of people trying to take the power away from a word by publicly using it amongst themselves, while demanding no one else use it (and further condemning anyone who does), only further segregates the group in a collective society. \\n\\nI knew this would be a controversial issue, but I felt the classroom was an appropriate place to have a real dialogue about it (especially since it was on-topic with the lecture that day). So, I voiced that I disagreed with her view. I explained my stance very much like I have here. I went on to say that I feel calling a gay person ‚Äòfaggot‚Äô, is akin to calling someone ‚Äòn-word‚Äô (I said the word itself). \\n\\nI felt that in an academic environment where the power and impact of words is at the core of the discussion, that it was necessary to convey the argument by relating the powerful reactions we can have to these words. However, my classmate did not seem to see it that way. She said she couldn‚Äôt believe I actually said that to her. I explained as I just did here, about the environment we were in and the discussion at hand, and that I felt it was not out of line, reiterating I felt it was important for comparing the impact of the two words. She simply said, ‚Äúfuck you, asshole‚Äù, and walked out of the classroom. \\n\\nNo one raised their voices or anything; she and I were both calm throughout the exchange, even through to her leaving the classroom. After class, I asked the professor if it was inappropriate what I said. She said she agreed with my point about being in an academic environment while discussing the power of such words, and that she felt the impact indeed had value for equal context. \\n\\nI never heard anything else about this incident. However, my classmate never came back to the class, and I hate to think I caused her to drop a class over this. Was I an asshole to use the n-word like that?',\n",

A thing of Oreos lasts me a month and he will eat all of them in one sitting. Same with cereal, Pop Tarts, cheese, chips, a jar of PB, etc. I don't eat junk food very often so these things last me awhile.

He says I'm welcome to anything when I'm at his place, but I don't have a third of the appetite he does so even if I did help myself to my heart's content, it wouldn't have even close to the same impact as him decimating my kitchen. Plus, he makes more money than I do. I've tried to explain this to him but he really didn't get the scope of the issue, so I started to track everything he ate while at my house. I made a spreadsheet that encompassed a single month to demonstrate how much he was eating and how much it was costing me. \\n\\nMy monthly food budget is $150, he was eating over a third of it at $54. I presented this to him and he seemed really confused? He said he'd give me the $54, NBD. But I don't want money, I want him to not go to town on my food. We kind of got into an argument about it and he called me a weird for making a spreadsheet and said it was passive aggressive. I disagree.

He seemed to like them too and they accepted him as part of the gang. I thought he had some respect for these intelligent, adorable little rodents. I\\'m doubting that now.\\n\\nVery recently two of my boys got an upper respiratory infection, a standard illness for rats and quite easy to treat if caught in time. I took them both to the vet to get the medicine they needed. They were ok otherwise.\\n\\nI came back from the vet and my boyfriend and I talked about vet bills (I am entirely self dependent and we do not share a bank account, all the vet bills were paid with my own savings. We are absolutely not short of money in any way). \\nI told him the total price of the medication/consultation came out to $120.\\nHe was pissed. Told me I \"wasted my money, they\\'ll probably die anyway\" and stormed off. He refused to talk to me for the rest of the day. \\n\\nWhen I woke up and went to feed my rats, the same as I do every day, my two boys with the URIs didn\\'t come to say hi like they usually do. All of my other rats were around but my other two were in their bed at the back of the cage. They were barely breathing, and they were cold. Most URIs don\\'t progress this fast so I made an emergency appointment with my vet the same day.\\n\\nMy white rat, Ghost, survived. It seems he was fine, he just wanted to keep his brother safe. He is perfectly healthy and recovering well currently. My other boy, Grunt, died cuddled up to me an hour before I saw the vet. I was inconsolable. I\\'m still heartbroken. The vet agreed to look into it and suggested perhaps an allergy to the medication was the cause.\\n\\nWhen I got home my boyfriend was up and we talked about everything that had gone on including the money issue. I explained what happened and there was no comforting at all.\\n\\nHe snorted and said \"I told you they were a waste of money, just get a new one next week\".\\nMe: \"Are you serious?\"\\nHim: \"Well yeah, it\\'s cheaper to buy a new rat than treat one so just let them die and we can replace them\"\\nMe: \"They\\'re not toys you can just throw out\"\\nHim: \"They\\'re rodents, it doesn\\'t matter if they die\"\\n\\nI lost my shit. I told him to pack his shit and get out and he called me a psychotic bitch and said that rats are filthy vermin. Then he left. I know he\\'s staying with his parents so he definitely had somewhere to go. Everyone is siding with him and I feel so lost and alone.\\n\\nTl:dr - My boyfriend thinks paying vet bills for my rats is too expensive so he\\'d rather let them die and buy new ones, so I broke up with him and kicked him out. AITA?',\n",

He also suffers from PTSD, insomnia, and depression so I try to let him do the things he enjoys to help him with his hardships.\\n\\nFast forward to the present, I have never hosted a event for my family as I have always been super busy with work. My nephew, who I love very dearly was about to turn 2, so I decided to offer to host the party for my sister since I know her house is extremely messy since she has to take care of a infant.\\n\\nOnce I started cleaning I realized how unsuitable our home might appear to guests, we have many flags, medals, and guns mounted everywhere around the house. I decided that the biggest thing that needed to be addressed were the weapons, so I asked if we could temporarily take them down.\\n\\nHe agreed to take them all down except for one, which is located right above our fireplace. His reason being that his very close friend died literally by his side in battle, and something he had always promised was to keep and honor all of his memorabilia, as he doesn‚Äôt have a wife or children. \\n\\nHe believes removing his weapon from the mantle would be a dishonor to his friend, and thinks that he is already being accommodating enough by removing the rest of the weapons. \\n\\nI‚Äôm not that satisfied on one hand I do empathize for my husband, on the other I don‚Äôt want parents to be uncomfortable with a weapon in their view, especially with kids around.\\n\\nAny advice is appreciated, if you have any questions feel free to ask.

       " 'I‚Äôll try to make this as short as possible. \\n\\nA few years back I met a wonderful guy (we‚Äôll call him Henry) who had come to my city from another country to do an internship. We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can‚Äôt sponsor him bc it‚Äôs too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we‚Äôre still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn‚Äôt fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \\n\\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we‚Äôll call him Jake. Now I‚Äôm the type of person who doesn‚Äôt like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don‚Äôt bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I‚Äôm going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that‚Äôs more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \\n\\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He‚Äôs pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \\n\\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I ‚Äúlied about being married.‚Äù I explained to him many times why I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I‚Äôm a liar. Is he right? AITA\\n\\nEdit: to the people that think my marriage was a scam or green card fraud, it was not. I didn‚Äôt want to go into all of the details about the marriage bc I didn‚Äôt want to waste anyone‚Äôs time when this was more about if I should have told my new boyfriend sooner or not. But now this needs explaining. \\n\\nThe person I married was MY BOYFRIEND. We had an apt together. We went to his country together so I could meet his family. It wasn‚Äôt a pretend marriage it was just a marriage that we entered into sooner than was ideal bc we wanted to stay together. It wasn‚Äôt fraud. \\n\\nEdit 2: some of you seem to not comprehend what I am asking. I am not asking you if you think I‚Äôm an asshole for not getting divorced. That is none of your business. I‚Äôm asking AITA for not telling my bf within 2 months of knowing him that I was still legally married. Please stop calling me an asshole for a ‚Äúsham marriage.‚Äù It‚Äôs not the point of this post. \\n\\nEdit 3: Guys I kinda messed up. At the time that he found out about the marriage, he wasn‚Äôt my boyfriend. The way I wrote this was from the current situation as he is now my boyfriend. \\n\\nWe had been dating online and we live in separate states. Before this happened, I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to call it a relationship until after we met, but I told him that I wouldn‚Äôt be seeing anyone else because that‚Äôs just how I am. But I did make it clear that until we met and I knew for sure that we would get along in person, I wouldn‚Äôt enter into a serious relationship with him. ',\n",

I met her through Tinder and we hit it off right away and were fwb for awhile but she didn't want to date. Said she wasn't a big fan of dating because things just get more stressful. I asked if she could be a little more specific about what she found stressful cause I wanted to be the one to erase those stresses. She opened up about some shit that happened in her life and how she had revenge porn of her spread online. I wasn't too sure why that mattered for a relationship, but she said she didn't want to date someone who used porn because of her dislike for it. She gave me several reasons why she disliked it but those aren't important. I told her I wasn't a big fan of porn and if I had her as my girlfriend I would cut it out entirely. She was so special to me and it seemed like no big deal. \\n\\nWe started dating soon after and things have been great until she found out I've been using porn. This was a couple days ago and she has been very distant ever since. Told me she felt disgusting and didn't know if she could stay in a relationship with me. I don't fucking understand. Everyone watches porn. Sometimes I just want to get my rocks off and look at something else for a change. I think it's ridiculous to expect your partner to get off without EVER using other people. I know I said I could cut it, but that's stupid. I kept watching it because she wouldn't know and it didn't impact our relationship in any way. Didn't change how I viewed her and didn't ruin our sex life. I think she's being ridiculous right now for distancing herself and being so extreme, saying she doesn't think she can date me over PORN. It feels stupid just typing it out. She's making me seem like a total jerk and this isn't something I want to talk about with my friends IRL. So here I am. AITA?? \",\n",

       " \"My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.\\n\\nThe mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.\\n\\nRegardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.\\n\\nThing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.\\n\\nI absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.\\n\\nAITA?\",\n",

I barely know how to use the stove.\\nMom: Your sister (14) made her own dinner.\\nMe: You actually taught her how to cook. Can you at least drive me to the store so I can buy something I CAN cook? (I can't drive either, she doesn't trust me behind the wheel, surprise surpise)\\nMom: No, I'm not buying you food when we already have lots\\n\\nThis argument keeps going around until I get fed up and go to my room. That was an hour ago and I'm super hungry. Detailed instructions on how to make a grilled cheese are welcome.\\n\\nBut anyways, AITA?\\n\\nEDIT: I should have made it more clear: my mother doesn't trust me in the kitchen. She will not allow me to learn how to cook because she thinks I would fuck it up. She is contridicting her own damn self when she tells me to teach myself. If it where that easy to teach myself than believe me, I would've done it by now. But having your mother screaming at you for stirring the noodles wrong and then taking over instead of helping you is really annoying.\\n\\nUPDATE/EDIT 2: I turned off notifications to do homework and go to bed. Wow. It's very clear that I am the asshole. And I have to agree. I should not have given my mom attitude. I apologized to her this morning and asked her to at least teach me the basics. She refused. I see now that the only way I'm gonna learn is to do it myself. I want to try some simple recipes over the weekend and hope I don't burn the house down.

John and I were an happy couple, I lived everything about him. His personnaility was amazing his physique was a tad feminine but I actually liked it a lot. I was falling in love pretty hard and we never really had a complete relation or sex. We've been together 7 months and he pleasured me but I actually never had the occasion to pleasure him in return. He has told me about 3 months into the relation he had a micropenis and was really shy about this so I didn't really mind doing cuddles and stuff without an actual penetration because I respected him and his insecurities. \\n\\nNow, foward to 7 months into our relation (about 2 weeks ago). I talked to him and asked him if I could do anything to make him more comfortable because I care for him and I wanted to show him it's not a problem to me. Which really isn't as I'm bi and I don't have any issues with sizes. He said no and told me in a really rude way that it was none of my business and I should just enjoy what he is giving me. I was really sad and frustrated so I left his place and went to a common friend of our. The friend told me that John made her swear to not say anything but in fact she used to be a girl and is on transition for 6 years now but never did the operation. I felt betrayed and lied too. I was so angry. I slept it off. \\n\\nThe next day I went back to his place and ask him to tell me the truth. He told me I was stupid and it should not matter. I replied it does matter if it's a lie. He told me I was an asshole and I should just love him the way he his and he shouldn't have to specify he was transgender. \\nHe clearly soenst see my point and at this point I broke up with him. \\n\\nNow everyone seems to think I'm this transphobic asshole who left this poor person and his family are sending me messages almost everyday to remind me how awful I am and how bad I broke his heart. \\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here ? \\n\\n-sorry for my bad English I'm French and my grammar is pretty weak\\n\\nEdit 1: Thank you for all the comments wow !!! Didn't think this will blow out lie that. So little update. I spoke to him this morning, I told him I was sorry and explained in details what was wrong and why I broke up. He understood and said sorry too. He was really scared that is leave him if I knew and reacted badly because of that, I explained it was the lie and not the actual transgender thing. We agreed to be friends and I'll be sure to help him out when he will go dating I'll be there for him and we are happy like that. His family is still against me but at this point I don't care. In all its an happy ending. We agreed he was mostly the asshole bit I understood and forgave him completely. Thanks again guys !!\",\n",
       " \"Sorry for length but there needs to be some context.\\n\\nMy wife and I are ex-athletes and both over 6 feet. She works an office job and hits the gym about once a week. I have a physically demanding job and lift weights 3x a week. At the end or the day I'm tired and super hungry despite eating all day. It's no problem for me to crush 8000-10,000 plus calories in a day. My wife is a big snacker so we both pretty much eat all day.  All while we dated she's eaten less than me. However over the passed 6 months or so she has been eating on average double what I eat at dinner. \\n\\nI look at food as fuel and I don't like feeling stuffed after any meals. I usually eat one large full plate of food for dinner. However my wife likes to eat until she needs to unbutton her pants. I'm not exaggerating. She regularly now gets a second plate when I'm not even finished my first.\\n\\nI noticed that when we are out with other people or with family she always gets more food than me and it makes me feel like less of a man. I know it sounds stupid but something about her outeating me at the dinner table just feels weird. If it was an extra bread stick or something is one thing but its usually another full plate of everything. Also we have strangely similar tastes and often order the same thing without discussing doing so, so it's not like she gets two salads versus my t-bone steak.\\n\\nThe other night we were eating with my parents and after everyone was finished she grabbed another plate. Afterwards I asked her if she would consider eating as much as me when we eat meals together. I was careful not to offend her and didn't want to upset her. She wasn't offended and said she would and has since then. Now I feel bad, like I'm holding her back or something.\\n\\nFor the record I have no problem with her weight so that's not the issue here. She has gained about 25lbs since  we got married (5yrs) but since she's so tall she carries it well, and looks awesome.  I assume she'd gain more weight if she kept this up but that isn't why I asked her to slow down.\",\n",

I'm plain-looking and quite tomboyish - very studious and not interested in fashion or dating at all.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere's the argument:\\n\\nMy parents believe bras are a form of underwear and that it's gross not to wear one. They often ask me if I'm wearing one (which in my mind proves it makes no difference if people can't even tell whether or not I have one), and if I say no, they won't let me leave the house. Mum often comments things like 'don't you want boys to like you?' or 'you like like a boy, you should be more feminine'. My mum feels that I do not care about my body and I'm being lazy by not wearing one. I went out without a bra once accidently (in winter, wearing 3 layers of clothing) and was yelled at and told I was ungrateful.\\n\\nI find bras very unnecessary and uncomfortable. A-cups are too big for me, they're awkward and bulky most of the time and I think mum's comments are really inappropriate. Nobody but her cares about my boobs. I understand that for most people it would be highly inappropriate to not wear a bra but I just don't have boobs. Bras are about support and modesty. I have nothing to support. She's right, I might as well be a boy, why is that a bad thing?\\n\\nI lost my temper in our most recent disagreement over it. Mum sent me a video about execerises that make your boobs look bigger. I didn't ask, I don't care, and I feel like deep down she's disappointed she gave birth to a flat-chested, tomboyish daughter rather than a gorgeous popular one. I told my mum to stop projecting her own body image insecurities onto me because I'm perfectly okay with my small bust and that it's my own damn decision what to think about my body. I feel bad for saying that because she started crying but it was in the heat of the moment and she was waaaay out of line imo. \\n\\nI acknowledge this who thing is quite biased but I just can't see the logic in trying to make your mosquito-bite-titted daughter feel bad and want to change the way she is.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: Basically, I have no boobs and don't want to wear a bra.

As a Legal Assistant, my duties are LEGAL related, ie; editing and drafting documents, calendar management, processing client payments, filing documents at court, phone coverage, etc.  However, the new Associate assigned me her PERSONAL duties:  Grocery shopping, driving across town in traffic to buy her favorite chocolates, making returns to clothing stores, driving to her house to let maintenance technicians in, etc.  She yelled at me a lot.

Im not making that up or lying and if you see the name below you can check for yourself.\\n\\n(Repost letter count)\\ntldr: I hired a cleaner for a certain number of hours, i lied about the size of the house because i only wanted him to clean the bottom floor (so it hired him for 4 hours), he cleaned it so quickly so there is time to work on the upstairs but he is angry that there are more bedrooms and bathrooms than listed, even tho ive told him he doesnt have to finish it all, only the time i hired him for.\\n\\nSo, I used an app to pay for a cleaner to come today, Its something me and my siblings do when we use our parents house when they travel (we are between the ages of 17 - 22 so we can pull together enough money for it) and when they are away, we have more freinds over than usual, might have a house party. They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can. But hiring a proffesional with their tools and solutions really helps.\\n\\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\\n\\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or it would\\'ve \\n have hired the cleaner for much longer.\\n\\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\\n\\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\\n\\nHes still huffing and getting annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hired him for and then leave. Even if its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.',\n",

D doesn‚Äôt speak/understand it, so I think it‚Äôd be tacky.

       " \"Today I was at the store with my 2 y/o daughter. She's a really good kid , so I rarely have to apologize for something she does or my bad parenting decisions. I often get compliments on how well behaved she is and her calm temperament, but make no mistake, she is still a toddler, so we have our moments.\\n\\nWe are at the checkout line and we are 2nd in line. They're two cashiers next to each other at a counter, so there is a lady in front of me (lady #1) and another lady in front of me (lady #2) , but off to the right a bit, maybe 2 feet away from us. My kid is acting up a little and trying to run off from me in the line, but no one has noticed us and no attention is being drawn. I grab her hand and she giggles a little loudly, as she thinks it's funny, then drops her toy she had in her hand. She gets down to retrieve it, but when she gets up she is very close to lady #2, and in that split second she thought she was me and hugs her legs from behind, her head landing between her legs, right under her butt.\\n\\nI quickly called out my daughter's name to help her realize,Whoa, that ain't mommy. The look on her face when she realized that she was hugging a stranger was priceless and a funny  honest mistake. I'm laughing and herding my daughter back over to me. this lady turns around and she is pissed. She was about 25 and she was giving my daughter a look as if she was a 40 year old slimeball who just grabbed her ass. \\n\\nI get not all people like kids and I respect that, but I thought she was going to hit my kid with the look she had on her face. She continued to stay turned staring at my daughter with a scowl of hatred. Now I'm already laughing, but I'm a nervous laugher on top it. So when I see this lady acting like she is about to unwind on my kid, the laughing just continues. The lady then glares at me and I cant help myself.. I keep laughing, but I glared right back. I said nothing. Normally I'm a pushover and very easy and quick to apologize for anything and everything, but the fact that she seemed so offended by a kid accidently hugging her, it almost wanted to make me see red. I hugged my daughter and then looked up at this woman who had the most ugly twisted face at this point and I just smiled and raised my eyebrows as to ask if there was a problem here.\\n\\nThis whole thing lasted maybe 15 seconds, but fuck that time lasted forever. Lady #1then turns around and is now just staring at me and my daughter as well, shaking her head a bit in disapproval. That gets me thinking, wow, did I just make a parenting fuck up that I should have apologized for instead of laughing at this woman and her reaction? So was I the asshole in all of this?\\n\\nNormally i would apologize at the drop of a hat, but the way this lady looked at my daughter with such hatred really just pissed me off badly. What do you guys think? Did mama bear mode get the best of me? I kinda fear I'm the asshole\\n\\n\\nEdit: I'm the asshole. I could and should have easily diffused the situation with a quick apology for my daughter's accidental hug, but I just laughed in a way that could be taken very offensively. That's where I fucked up and should have shut up . To the random lady in the store, if your reading this, I'm sorry!

It has been pretty eye opening to say the least, I\\'m going to confront her in the morning. I\\'ll post another update for anyone still interested. \\n\\nSo about a year ago I popped the big question. I was deeply in love with my girlfriend and everything felt amazing. That is until she transformed into a bridezilla in front of my eyes. \\n\\nEver since we got engaged all she can do is talk about the wedding, which was fine at first but it started to consume her. I thought that I would get some say in how the day was going to go but everything I suggest is immediately shot down. The only choice I got to make was my tux and even that had to fit her God damn color scheme. \\n\\nWell things really started ramping up when her mother came down for the weekend. She\\'s your typical trailer trash woman who married into a successful family. All her ideas are awful and tacky yet my fiancee laps it up like a dehydrated person in a desert. When I try to bring it up with her she tells me that this is \"her\" big day and I should just be supportive. I told her it was my money and that I should have more say in how it\\'s spent. Her mom picked out maroon table clothes with flowers and suns on them, I feel like it\\'s a funeral for a carnival worker. She even suggested we have beer kegs on tap.\\n\\nSo the last straw was that her and her mother, without my consent, used my credit card as a payment on a venue down by a river instead of the church we discussed where my family has attended for generations and made many contributions, the pricing was even a little cheaper minus the price of the hall afterwards.

It has been pretty eye opening to say the least, I\\'m going to confront her in the morning. I\\'ll post another update for anyone still interested. \\n\\nUpdate 2: I tried creating a new thread but don\\'t understand how the filters work. Here\\'what happened after. \\n\\nI got a lot of great advice from my post last and the main thing that I took away was that someone using your money for large purchases behind your back is a big red flag. Well it turns out you guys were right because I decided to look into our finances regarding the wedding and found a lot more than I bargained for. \\n\\nI have a large savings account that I have been putting money into for the last 8 years or so, about a year back my fiancee ran into some vehicle trouble and it was a hassle so I gave her access to my account in case of emergencies in the future. This same account is what we were using for a lot of the wedding expenses. We agreed on a maximum price that we could spend out of it and everything else would have to come directly out of pocket. I don\\'t often keep tabs on the account because really it\\'s in the back of my mind, I put money out of each check into it and move on.\\n\\n Well after all this went down yesterday I decided to check all my finances and found out that not only had she exceeded the limit we had agreed too, but that some of the money coming out didn\\'t make sense. She had transfered almost $2000 to her mother recently. I confronted her about this today and her answer was that her mom needed the money to come down because she can\\'t be spending her money right now due to a new business venture her mother and father are involved in. I was angry because it\\'s bullshit that not only is the mother and father not helping with the wedding but we have to pay for them the entire time too. These people are pretty well off so it\\'s pretty ridiculous. That wasn\\'t the end of it though because after more arguing my fiancee told me that she paid for her mother and her dad to come down last time too and it wasn\\'t a big deal and that I didn\\'t even notice the money was gone so who cares. \\n\\nAfter learning all this I told her the wedding was off for now until I get a chance to think things through. She cried and begged for another chance but I wouldn\\'t budge I told her I need time. She\\'s staying at the hotel with her mother tonight and I\\'m not sure what I\\'m going to do yet. I\\'m so mad right now and feel really betrayed. I don\\'t know if she\\'s the right one for me anymore. \\n\\nWe have talked over the phone recently but still haven\\'t gotten anywhere. It\\'s a pretty tough situation all around. \\n\\nThanks for listening everyone. I\\'ll update more if you\\'re still interested.  \\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Hello everyone,\\n\\nI have been with my (now ex) fiance for just about four years and recently broke off our engagement due to his parent\\'s racist remarks at a restaurant.  We were to be married in June of this year.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, we met at a work conference in 2015 and maintained a long distance relationship (he lived in CA, I lived in N.C.) and made it work.  We got together for about a week every two months or so, and during this time, I met his family and he subsequently met mine when we were in each other\\'s towns.  There were no red flags, not even a hint of how racist his parents really are - I ultimately found this out a few weeks ago.\\n\\nWe (me, him, and his parents) were out to dinner a few weeks ago and this little boy, must have been six years old or so, accidentally tripped our waitress resulting in dropped plates and food getting all over his mother and father. \\n\\nI had never seen such a dramatic shift in mood, but my future father-in-law stood up and started spewing A LOT of hateful remarks about people of other races -- I\\'ll spare you all the details, but it was extremely vile and disgusting stuff.  People started recording on their phones.  It was a HUGE scene that left me VERY embarrassed and ashamed to be there - what makes matters even worse was that my mother-in-law did not disagree with him; she sat there nodding her head in agreement  My fiance didn\\'t say anything,he just sat there. He didn\\'t acknowledge what his father said, but the fact that he just let it go and didn\\'t stand up to him was very telling.\\n\\nThe day after this incident I drove over to his house and broke off our engagement.  Understandably, he was very upset and naturally we had a big argument which I\\'m sure the neighbors heard.  I know he didn\\'t say anything at dinner and I asked him point blank \"Are you a racist?\" - he did not answer, only turned away.  I\\'m not sure what that meant.\\n\\nI had absolutely no idea his family was like this and a big life lesson I have learned is to spend more time with a partner\\'s family before making any decisions.  I simply can not be with someone whose family harbors so much hate - the apple doesn\\'t drop far from the tree.\\n\\nWhat conflicts me is that his family paid for the entire wedding - everything from the venue, to the dresses, to the food, to the decorations.  Me personally, I don\\'t come from a lot of money and would have been happy with a nice backyard wedding.  But I know they spent a lot which makes me feel terrible.\\n\\nDoes this make me an asshole?',\n",

I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. \\n\\nShe came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more \"appropriate\" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.\\n\\nFor her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter\\'s absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she\\'s never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.\\n\\nLunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. \\n\\nSo I explained that she shouldn\\'t share \"spicy\" foods with her friends, and figured I\\'d skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn\\'t good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she\\'s requesting we make sure to send \"age appropriate\" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB & J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.\\n\\nI called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is \"a little kid\" and that she doesn\\'t need to worry about eating \"adult food\" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said \"No\" and \"This really shouldn\\'t be a big deal.\"\\n\\nThis might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I\\'m the parent, and there\\'s nothing wrong with my child\\'s diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she\\'d like, but that unless there\\'s some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up. \\n\\nJust to double check, I asked my daughter two things: Does she LIKE her lunches? (Enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and \"Are the other kids making fun of you?\" because I know that can be an issue. She said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. \\n\\nSo AITA, or is this teacher way out of line?',\n",

We find out we're pregnant and we are super happy, like over the moon ecstatic.  We couldn't wait for the 12 week mark to tell people, and started working on a nursery right away.\\n\\nHowever, we go to our scan and find out we are having FOUR babies. Four. That's insane. I'm cutting a lot of backstory out because honestly, it's hard for me to talk about. At the time, my husband and I are just in shock, but happy we have healthy babies.\\n\\nNow, I'm a small woman, 5'0 and very petite. At my next scan, it was suggested I consider aborting two of the pregnancies for the sake of my body, and to be honest, I was quietly considering bringing this idea up to my husband anyway because of the money involved with raising four children. We could afford two babies, but no way could we afford four.\\n\\nMe and my husband are distraught that this is our reality, but we went home and tried to figure it out. From our latest scan, we know we have identical twin girls and two fraternal boys in there. If we go through with the selective abortion, which we most likely will, I brought up that I would like to keep the two girls as they are identical twins (I'm hoping they have the 'twin bond') and also, to be honest, I've always wanted girls.\\n\\nMy husband is on board with this, but as soon as I told my mother and sister the scenario they kicked off, calling us selfish, entitled, saying we are searching for designer babies, etc.\\n\\nThe way I see it is that we have to make a choice which babies go if we do this, and it breaks our hearts that we are in this position but we need to do what we can for the sake of our children.

My boyfriend knew this and definitely knew my rule because I asked him over and over not to include other people.\\n\\nIn spite of this, he decided to propose by first asking my children (from my first marriage) for permission and then included them in the actual proposal by having them hold up signs during the proposal. I wanted to be happy in the moment, but I was so hurt that he went against the one request I made.\\n\\nI ended up taking him aside and asking him why he ignored what I asked of him. He told me it was different because they're my children and us getting married is their decision as much as it is mine and his. This really hurt me given that he knew how important my autonomy in the decision was to me. I told him I couldn't say yes to the proposal given the circumstances.\\n\\nMy children are furious with me and my oldest won't even speak to me.

He\\'s always been cold towards me since, and I figured that\\'s just the way he is. He\\'s still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all.

The seats are small and my legs don‚Äôt fit as it is, plane is full, and 5 minutes into takeoff, the person in front of me (male, mid 30s,5‚Äô8) reclines his chair all the way back ruining any hopes of a comfortable flight. \\n\\nI politely asked him if he could move his seat back up since it‚Äôs less than an hour flight and he started giving me attitude telling me it wasn‚Äôt his issue and he finds the seats more comfortable arched back. I told him I was 6‚Äô5 and didn‚Äôt have leg space as it was. These arguments went back and forward for about a minute until a flight attendant had to come in and ask him to move it back. He finally moved his seat back up but he seemed genuinely mad that I had asked him to for more space and a flight attendant ended up siding with me. It‚Äôs been bothering me all day, so now I want to know, \\n\\nTLDR; AITA for asking a random person to move their seat up on a 55 minute plane ride because I didn‚Äôt have leg space?',\n",
       " \"I have an antique confederate battle flag framed in my home office. The flag has quite a storied history. First carried into WWII by my grandfather, it was then carried into Vietnam by my uncle, who passed away a few years ago. They do not have any ties to white supremacy nor did they hold any racist views. The flag is a family heirloom, not a political statement.\\n\\nMy wife was hosting a baby shower for a friend of hers. Out of nowhere, one of her friend's guests stepped out into the living room holding the very same framed flag above her head. She claimed she was looking for the bathroom when she opened the door to my office by mistake (very unlikely).\\n\\nEven when my wife explained the history behind the flag, she made a huge scene. During her rant about how her ancestors were slaves, she violently threw the frame on the ground, cracking the antique frame that had been in my family for three generations and sending glass shards all over the wooden floor. My wife's foot was cut quite badly by the glass, requiring three stitches. \\n\\nLong story short- cops were called, she was arrested, and charges will be filed. I have also retained a lawyer to go after her in civil court. As she works in the healthcare field, I am told a criminal record will be quite damaging to her career though it won't end it entirely. \\n\\nMy wife's friend apologized profusely for her guest's behavior and has offered to pay for any damages (I thanked her but I won't make her pay for someone else's mistake), but she made a comment about how I was overreacting and that I shouldn't ruin a young woman's life over this. She also said my flag should be in storage or a museum, not out on display. \\n\\nI understand the outrage at display of the flag in public buildings, but I feel like this was different. I did not have my flag out in my front yard, it wasn't in my living room, it was in my private office, behind closed doors. Moreso, her irrational behavior caused my wife to be injured. I don't know if I would want someone like her working in a hospital setting. Am I an asshole for thinking this girl was way out of line? \",\n",

I asked her to elaborate and she says \"For my GRANDSON to sleep over OF COURSE!\".\\n\\nShe lives over 2 hours away, has 2 very large dogs she cannot control, and has an.....\"agriculture\" business in her basement that smells the entire house.\\n\\nI told her \"Save your money because that\\'s not going to happen\".  She thinks I\\'m joking at first but when she sees I\\'m serious she start freaking out.\\n\\nFrom her perspective, she has waited 30 years for a grandchild and since my sister can\\'t have kids she fuels all of her excitement into us.  She has a fear of driving so her visits to us will be limited in the first place.  She is taking her excitement over the top. Her friends threw her a grandma shower for fucks sake.\\n\\nI told her that I will not be driving 5-10 hours per weekend so he can sleep over in a place where there are untrained massive dogs(they are sweeties but i don\\'t want to take the chance with a 250lb st Bernard and a 150lb Newfoundland that like to jump), and an offensive smell that permeates the house.\\n\\nShe responds saying she has thought of all that and will be taking the train, segregating the dogs, and installing a massive air purifier in the room.  I still tell her no with the logic of \"I don\\'t want my child being 2.5 hours away from me, I\\'m not comfortable with taking a baby on a train, we are trying to avoid formula, and even with the dogs being in another room and an air purifier where he would sleep I am not comfortable with the arrangement.  I told her we can visit once in a while, but not until he\\'s a little bit older and it\\'s unlikely we will be sleeping over(her home smells, is small and very uncomfortable).\\n\\nMy mother cries like she has just lost a child.  I call my sister and ask her for help(she lives a lot closer and has a much closer relationship), and she thinks I am being unreasonable.  Apparently, my mother has already gotten the room ready and has been saving up for this huge air purifier/ozone generator thing and talked through it with my sister because she knows I\\'m a hard-ass.\\n\\nEDIT:  Clarification... My mother isn\\'t a cold or bad-hearted person.  I guess when I was a baby my mom dumped me at my grandmothers every weekend, so she always thought this was a norm.  I am glad she is excited but I feel things like a grandma shower is a bit narcissistic.  I would never discourage her from spending time with our son.  When I said \"Never going to happen\" I meant as a baby, staying at her place alone.  Obviously when he\\'s older it\\'s a different story if shes still willing to be accommodating.  She is more than welcome to come over and spend time with him whenever she likes.',\n",

       " 'I(18F) come from a traditional family. My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it‚Äôs simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\\n\\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don‚Äôt need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn‚Äôt get it.\\n\\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it‚Äôs a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\\n\\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn‚Äôt even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn‚Äôt date a girl with a higher salary.\\n\\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way.

However I make JUST enough without overtime. \\n\\nSo I started working 10-12 hours days and occasionally picking up a sixth day a week. (Losing a 58k a year salary hurt. Even if I can solo the bills.) Very rarely I'll go a full seven, which in effect means working 12-13 days straight. I go to work at 5am to be there by six. This means I'm up at 4 am. Every day. Day in and day out. I don't mind doing this because I want my family to flourish and honestly I love providing for them. Lately tho my wife has been pissing me off about me not pulling my weight with the baby at night... \\n\\nI usually don't get home from work until around 7pm.

Really it's not even extra. It's just enough for me to function.\\n\\nLast night she was on a kick again and she said the fucking L word. She called me lazy. I've never been lazy a day in my life. Even on my days off I'm fixing things around the house, maintaining the vehicles, etc. I was furious and told her I shouldn't have to get up with the baby at all seeing as I don't get a 2-3 hour nap every day.

So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it\\'s okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\\n\\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I\\'ll come home and find he\\'s disappeared with the gate open and I\\'ll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she\\'s at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don\\'t mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I\\'m sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\\n\\nI\\'ve just got a few issues with some of it.

We fight and make fun of each other but we're in love. My mother however, dislikes my girlfriend and has made no attempt since we were ten and first met to try and make a relationship. She wanted me to have nothing to do with her and saw her as a rowdy delinquent and not a good influence on me. My girlfriend will tell you herself that she was terrible person as a kid but she's grown up a lot since then, we both have.\\n\\nWe mutually decided that we would wait until after university for marriage and kids and used condoms plus pulling out. But like everyone says it only takes one time and my girlfriend is pregnant after one night without a condom. My mom found out from my brother after he let accidentally let it slip. We were gonna tell her after we returned home from a summer long visit to my grandparents on my late father's side in California (found out in August 2018)  but I told my brother beforehand for advice on what to tell her and he somehow let it slip to her. So we returned early from the trip and well mom flipped her shit and yelled at us for being reckless (we expected as much) when we got in the car then asked us what were our plans. We told her we were gonna keep it and she told us we need to to think about it more before deciding what to do it. My girlfriend told her we had spent two weeks thinking about since we found out and decided to keep the baby. Mom told us we were making a mistake and we'd regret it and the rest of the ride was tense and silence after that. Me and my girlfriend moved into our own place (with help from our grandparents) and my mom and I didn't talk the whole pregnancy.\\n\\nLast week, we welcomed our son into the world and a made a post on Facebook about it only to get a call from my mother consisting mostly of her tearing me a new one for not 'making her get an abortion' (exact words)  and trying to convince me to 'run while he can't remember me'. I told her to fuck off and hung up in her face. Yesterday she called and and apologized and asked when she could see her grandson. I asked if my brother also had a son I didn't know about and told her that as far as I was concerned, she gave up the right to be in his life when she told me to run and that she would NEVER see him until I say so. She started to cry and hung up.\\n\\nMy brother messaged me and told me I was 'too harsh' and 'she was just trying to look out for me' and that I should apologize and let her see him now that she's changed her tune. My mother's parents are also pissed at me for this but my girlfriend is on my side. I'm starting to wonder if we were too harsh on her and was she really trying to look after me?\\n\\nEdit: To address some things that came up regarding Grandparents' rights, this is my state's law regarding it:\\nYou have a very strong relationship with your grandchild and you see him or her routinely - a few times a year is probably not enough;\\n\\nYou have not been seeing your grandchild but you have tried very hard to see him or her; or,\\n\\nAt least one of the child‚Äôs parents has died.\\n\\nEdit 2: While I didn't respond to every judgement,  I made a point read them all (Well most of them). Thank you guys for all the advice. We'll spend the next few weeks with our son and decide whether or not my mother should be in his life and what would be best. We'll be meeting with her without our son after we've thought about and explain our decision. Also, to those who suggested birth control, my girlfriend said she'd look into it more and avoid her cousin's medical advice.\\n\\nThank you kind internet strangers for the advice and judgement!\",\n",

My wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would.

My hate is mostly directed at my  parents, but also at my brother as well, for two things: The first is a  couple of years ago when I was a victim of a crime. My brother took the  day off from work to take me to the state attorney's office to give a  deposition. Then he drove me back home in silence, dropped me off and  immediately left afterwards. He didn't ask me how it was, or anything.  Due to the lack of support from my family, I ended up dropping the  charges against my abuser because I wasn't strong enough to handle the  trial alone. I am very upset about this. I needed support and no one was  fucking there for me. Story of my life. Then, when I got sick and  started seeing an oncologist, I asked my brother if he'd come with me  for the results. He said he had to work. Funny thing about that! I know  his boss and all of his coworkers very well. Small business. Very family  like.

Of course they didn't take it well, but I don't care. I didn't  want to die and have these assholes think we're straight. I may have  tolerated them in life, but I didn't want there to be any doubt now that  I'm dying.

Because the Best Man has never actually planned a bachelor party before, my husband is doing most of the planning. In his friend group, they usually do a golf weekend. Also, this is likely the last bachelor party in the group as the rest of the guys are already married. \\n\\nHowever, we have a 2 year old and I‚Äôm currently pregnant with our second child and due on August 25th. When he started planning the bachelor party, I told him that planning something earlier in the summer would give him a higher chance of going for the full weekend.  I originally framed it as not wanting to be stuck watching our toddler by myself for a full weekend in my third trimester while he‚Äôs out golfing, which was a mistake. \\n\\nThey finally picked a date for the bachelor weekend. It‚Äôs August 8th - so I‚Äôll be 37 weeks pregnant and considered full term. It‚Äôs about two weeks before my actual due date. The bachelor party will be in another state, about 2 hours away from where we live (without traffic). On previously golf weekends, he has been terrible about keeping his phone charged and it can be hard to get in touch with him.  Also, while he doesn‚Äôt drink, he does smoke pot, and would most likely be smoking the whole weekend. \\n\\nHe thinks that as long as he gets someone to watch our toddler while he‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs fine to go for the full weekend (2-3 nights). This makes me incredibly nervous. I am willing to compromise and let him go for a night plus a day of golf.  I would also stipulate that he has to keep his phone on and charged at all times, and that he would have to stay sober in case I go into labor.  He seems to think this is an unreasonable compromise. I‚Äôm of the mindset that there are very few times in our marriage where my needs/wants/desires take priority over his, and that this is one of them. \\n\\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting him to go to a bachelor party for 2-3 nights so close to my due date?

       " \"  Last night I was having a lot of trouble falling asleep. At about 2 AM I hear my boyfriend call out my name softly but I ignore him because I don't want to focus and stop drifting off. He calls out again a few more times and I pretend not to hear him. He goes to poke me but I don't move because I'm in too deep now. He sighs and leaves the room. \\n\\n\\n  I hear the engine of the car turn on and he leaves in it. At this point I was wide awake and was wondering where he was going. At first I thought maybe he was... I don't know, taking in the scenery in the dead of the night? But then I recall how he made sure I wasn't awake before he took off and it didn't take long before I thought of him cheating on me.\\n\\n\\n  I intended on staying awake and confronting him when he came home but I fell asleep some time later. Today I wake up and see him getting dressed. I look him in the eye and ask him where he was last night, he froze and left the room without saying anything else. I chased after him and he wouldn't give me a clear answer, said it's none of my business and to stop being so nosy and leave him alone. He said all of that in an angry tone yet he was crying too. I don't know what to think. Was I out of line? \\n \",\n",

       " 'I (F20) have been living with my roommate (F20) for about a year now. We‚Äôve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she‚Äôs a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren‚Äôt friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\\n\\n\\nShe doesn‚Äôt really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can‚Äôt afford to eat out). \\n\\n\\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, or a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn‚Äôt really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\\n\\n\\nLately though, it‚Äôs been getting much worse and it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I‚Äôve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I‚Äôve already opened.\\n\\n\\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she‚Äôs been bulimic for a long time, she knows it‚Äôs wrong, but she can‚Äôt help binging on my food sometimes, et cetera. Also that she doesn‚Äôt want to be like this but she‚Äôs stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I‚Äôm sorry she has that issue but it shouldn‚Äôt be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there‚Äôs something wrong with her but it‚Äôs not like she can‚Äôt control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people‚Äôs tables. I told her that and I don‚Äôt understand why this is any different; it‚Äôs not socially acceptable to take other people‚Äôs property regardless of what‚Äôs wrong with you. She also said she knows she not a good roommate because of this so she tries to make up for it by being good in other ways (like being the one to clean every week) and trying not to let her problems affect me (the examples she gave were not crying loudly or puking when I was home). I didn‚Äôt say it but I think it‚Äôs disgusting to know that someone has been regularly puking in my bathroom.\\n\\n\\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven‚Äôt spoken or made eye contact since then, although I‚Äôm trying to be nice.

Sure, but I don‚Äôt because I know better. I‚Äôm just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \\n\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: I wish I had left out the bulimia part because everyone is fixating on that.

She announced yesterday that she was bringing a guest speaker to our classroom, a woman (and close friend of hers) who tours schools giving speeches on the dangers of drunk and distracted driving. This woman lost her young daughter in a drunk driving accident and is a severe burn victim, and my teacher told us ahead of time that her presentation will be an extremely emotional one, as she will describe the accident she experienced in detail.\\n\\nMy teacher stated that we all need to be on our very best behavior, and treat her with the highest of respect. She established that there will be **no** interruptions of her presentation tolerated; so that means no going to the bathroom and no tardy arrivals. She stated that she was locking the door at the start of class, and that any students who didn‚Äôt have the respect to show up on time would have to sit outside the duration of the period.\\n\\nI obviously planned on arriving on time to that class (as I always do), but was called up to the office near the end of the preceding period, and by the time I was let go we were already a good 5-10 minutes into the next period. I hustled over to my classroom and knocked on the door, and through the window I was met by a huge scowl from my teacher, a shake of her head, and a gesture to wait outside. I gestured to the office, trying to indicate that‚Äôs why I was late, but she turned her head away and ignored me. The woman giving the speech didn‚Äôt notice me, as she was very invested in her presentation. At this point, she was talking at length about the morning before she got into the crash, detailing emotionally the last few hours she spent with her daughter alive.\\n\\nIt was quite cold, stormy, and unpleasant outside, and I **really** wanted to get in. I understand my teacher‚Äôs rule, but think that it‚Äôs horribly unfair someone should have to sit outside in the cold if they have a legitimate excuse for being late. I started knocking very hard and loud against the door, rapping against the window, calling out, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm out here! Can someone let me in?‚Äù, and waving my arms around in front of the window. About 30 seconds later, the woman stops and says, ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a student out there. Can someone let him in?‚Äù Someone ran over and finally let me in, and my teacher flashed me another gigantic scowl. Fairly soon after, the lady continued her speech, and things went smoothly the rest of the period.\\n\\nAt the end of the class, my teacher scolded me for not listening and interrupting the speech giver, and gave me a detention even after I explained that I had an excuse for being late.

       " 'Before I get judged to quickly, let me explain. \\n22 years ago, I had a one night stand and accidentally got the woman pregnant. I didn‚Äôt want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who‚Äôs about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \\n\\n\\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn‚Äôt willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I‚Äôm planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my ‚Äúreal‚Äù family as opposed to her because I haven‚Äôt paid anything for her college career. But, there‚Äôs so many reason I‚Äôm not comfortable paying for her education, including:\\n\\n1. I pay child support. I‚Äôm a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \\n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son‚Äôs entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I‚Äôm giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son‚Äôs mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It‚Äôs not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \\n\\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I‚Äôm not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don‚Äôt appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I‚Äôm a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she‚Äôs less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to ‚Äúfuck off you sexist asshole‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt mean it like like the way she took it; I think she‚Äôs blowing it out of proportion. \\n\\n\\nTl;dr: Paying for son‚Äôs undergrad, but refused to pay daughter‚Äôs grad degree and I‚Äôm somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\\n\\nEdit: she wants the whole thing paid, not a portion. \\n\\n(Edit 3) I‚Äôm getting a lot of complaints about how I‚Äôm changing the story, so to be clear, she *first* phrased it as a contribution to her education, and then later on explained she wanted everything paid for. Like I said in edit 2, there was a character limit (I think it doesn‚Äôt apply when you edit), and I guess I erased the section that made that part clear.\\n\\nEdit 2: I was told to include below that her mom paid for undergrad and she has no loans right now. Sorry, reddit has a character limit and it was autoremoved so i had to take out details. \\n\\nGonna try to limit the edits, but just wanted to say that I know I come off defensive/abrasive in the comments, but I was annoyed that everyone was making me out to be a piece of shit for not being a piggy bank for a grown adult.',\n",

       " 'A bit of backstory. I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don\\'t care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I\\'m pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don\\'t care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn\\'t know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn\\'t want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I\\'ve written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It\\'s just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don\\'t lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she\\'s really dejected. I asked her what\\'s wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I\\'ve ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I\\'ve never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it\\'s existence. (She also said she hasn\\'t decided if I can have it back or not, and that she\\'s thinking about destroying it.)

I don‚Äôt ever want children, and when we got together, my bf informed me he had a vasectomy. Our conversation about safe sex didn\\'t progress much from there.\\n\\nLast week, I woke up needing to vomit. I told my boyfriend about it, but I was fine in the day so we both didn‚Äôt think much of it. After it had happened twice, I told a female friend about it. She asked me if I could be pregnant, and I said no way because of my bf\\'s vasectomy. She asked me when he had it done because after 10 years it may become less effective. I told her I was unsure, but I wasn\\'t worried because my period wasn‚Äôt late. Regardless, our talk did get me thinking about possibilities.\\n\\nThe next morning, I woke up nauseous for the third time. I had not taken a pregnancy test but decided to send my bf a text: \"Good morning, love. I woke up vomiting again. I don\\'t think I\\'m pregnant, but when did you get your vasectomy done? I had a conversation with \\\\[Renee\\\\] who said it could revert after 10 years, and it\\'s got me thinking about what we would do if something happened.\"\\n\\nMy bf replied back \"It was 15 years ago.

       " 'I‚Äôm currently studying for a Masters. 2x /week we‚Äôre put into groups to put together a presentation based on a problem we are given. \\n\\nIn session 1 we all read the problem together, spitball ideas, talk about what we already know and how it could relate to the problem, and draw up a list of things we don‚Äôt know that we need to know to be able to answer the problem. \\n\\nAt the end of session 1 we split up the questions & go away in our own time to do the research required to answer those questions. In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \\n\\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\\n\\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me ‚Äúso are we using what you did then?‚Äù Taken aback I said ‚Äúwell no we‚Äôll use a combination, what info have you found?‚Äù And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn‚Äôt even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn‚Äôt relevant.\\n\\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said ‚Äúis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?‚Äù and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said ‚ÄúHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?‚Äù at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn‚Äôt find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\\n\\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn‚Äôt found anything because I‚Äôd overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\\n\\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It‚Äôs true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn‚Äôt done any work.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn‚Äôt actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*',\n",

However I have always distilled in my team that they should treat the game as if it's 0-0 at all times. He also never asked for mercy during the game and seemed like a good sport about the result at the final whistle. Had he asked I probably would have told my players to go easy on them from that point.\\n\\nSo AITA for letting the score reach 19-1?\\n\\nUpdate: So judging from the replies there seems to be quite a large cultural split on this. Most of the Brits think I'm NTA, whilst a good portion of Americans think I'm TA. \\nI think next time I'll probably bring the subs on sooner and swap players positions more. However I don't agree with telling the kids to not give 100% and just pass the ball about, as this seems more disrespectful to the opposition imo.\",\n",
       " 'This girl and I have been hanging out together since the beginning of the school year. She is so fun and beautiful and vibrant, and has the perfect qualities for a girlfriend. She‚Äôs modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.\\n\\nThen it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn‚Äôt wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn‚Äôt? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.\\n\\nAfter that, I decided that I wasn‚Äôt going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn‚Äôt like me at all and he‚Äôs probably insecure about me, but I don‚Äôt care because I love our relationship. However, when I confessed all this to another friend, she called me creepy and threatened to tell the first girl about my feelings if I didn‚Äôt come clean or stop pursuing her. Am I the asshole for believing that there‚Äôs hope?',\n",
       " \"Hey guys. Please hear me out before making a judgement - I know it sounds awful. \\n\\nI was with my ex girlfriend (I'm a girl too) for 8 years. In the last year, we had a baby. It was a mutual thing but she carried the baby, etc. \\n\\nI was never too sure about having kids until recently and I decided I'd love to have a family with her. \\n\\nShe was always afraid of having a child because her mother and aunty and grandma all suffered from a severe post-natal depression. But, she powered through. \\n\\nShe gave birth to a baby boy who was biologically hers and a sperm donor. She funded the whole thing with her savings and I was there throughout the birth. \\n\\nAbout 6 months after our child was born, we broke up. It was mainly because I did not want to be tied down so young, all kinda stuff like that. It was mainly my choice but she understood and accepted it gracefully. \\n\\nWe stayed pretty friendly. \\n\\nI realised a few months later what a mistake I'd made and I tried to reach out. I practically begged her to take me back. She refused. \\n\\nI begged her to let us be a family (I'm the legal parent too as I adopted our baby after birth) and she said no, that at the time she was heartbroken but that I was right and she'd met another girl who she was dating. \\n\\nWe fell out. I was heartbroken and I was angry. \\n\\nWe stopped talking but she'd occasionally reach out asking me to see her son.\\n\\nWe met for coffee and I told her if she wants to be single and explore herself then I need that chance too. \\n\\nI told her I didn't want to see her but would have my kid on Friday nights. She said that was fine. \\n\\nShe then broached the subject of child support and said she had funded everything and hadn't received a penny off me. She said that she wanted reliable child support and help from me. I told her that's fine. I sent her her first load of money and the next day I had our son and I saw that she'd gone out drinking and to the cinema with her new girlfriend. \\n\\nWe got into a big argument and I told her that I'm not sending her any more money as she was just spending it on herself. She said that in 2 years I'd only paid ¬£150, she's paid everything else so if she wants to go out, she can. She then threw in my face that I'd been on holidays and stuff. \\nI said when I have my son on the Friday, I'll buy him whatever he needs, feed him, etc but that she had to cover the rest. She said I'm an asshole, so AITA?\\n\\n*Tl;Dr* my ex had my child. She wanted money from me, then went out drinking. I refuse to give her more money directly. \\n\\nEdit - title is meant to say pay, my bad :(\",\n",

I had only every been with women prior to my boyfriend, Jack. Jack seemed a pretty cool guy, he never really asked or showed interest in my past relationships which seemed like a chilled thing at the time, but now I\\'ve come to realise that it was probably more because he didn\\'t view my past relationships with women as important or simply was so disgusted by it that he couldn\\'t acknowledge it.

I\\'d been out with a friend earlier wearing it, then had to go to my home town and Jack suggested I take it off. I was like fuck no man, why would I take it off?? Because the people in my home town don\\'t like gay folk? That\\'s even more of a reason to wear it. \\n\\nJack didn\\'t really say anything about it and later when we got home I was giving the dog belly rubs and listening to Shania Twain and he just hit me out of nowhere with \"so you don\\'t take me seriously?\" And proceeded to go on a verbal tirade about how I have no respect for him, I embarrassed him and that I was acting single by wearing it out. He then said that I needed to decide if I was gonna define my life by my past or focus on our relationship. \\n\\nBeing bisexual is my present. Not my past. \\nI\\'m neither straight with with a man nor gay when with a woman. I like who I like.\\nI tried to explain to him that I have always struggled because in the gay community, I\\'m viewed as too straight and in the straight community I\\'m seen as too gay.

I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \\n\\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don\\'t know why but it\\'s just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma\\'s and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \\n\\nFiance is so furious at me she\\'s thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might as well have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \\n\\nAm I the asshole in this situation?',\n",
       " 'This happened a couple years ago but it was brought to my attention that the woman is still mad. \\n\\nMy mom married a guy I hate when I was 17. His family lived in Indiana, and it is about 9 hours of driving to get there. My mom and stepdad insisted we go down there for a visit during the summer I turned 20. I am now 25. I agreed to go simply because I hadn‚Äôt seen my ‚Äúnew uncles‚Äù in a year.  \\n\\nWell one evening my mom and I were sitting outside talking about shaving our legs (not sure how we ended up there, honestly). We both agreed that we usually just do a light shave instead of shaving everything (upper legs, bikini area, etc) unless we are going to have sex. We were laughing about it and my ‚Äústep grandma‚Äù came outside to smoke. \\n\\nSome info on this grandma. She was already mad at me for not calling her ‚Äúgramma Karen‚Äù (no joke, that‚Äôs her name). I didn‚Äôt call her that because?? I was 17 when she became part of ‚Äúmy‚Äù family. I already had a grandma. She was mad enough to make it clear I wasn‚Äôt welcome to stay at her house with my mom and siblings. Instead I spent the week at a nearby motel. \\n\\nSo anyways she hears my mom and I laughing and asks what we‚Äôre laughing about. My mom tells her we were talking about how lazy we are and don‚Äôt shave all the time. \\n\\nKaren immediately gets annoyed at not my mom, who is married to her son, but at me. She rounds on me, saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you have a boyfriend?‚Äù\\n\\nAt the time I‚Äôd been with a guy for three years and lived with him. So I told her yeah. \\n\\nShe then asks me why I‚Äôm not shaving daily for him. I ask her why do I need to? She says I should be trying to look nice for him. I tell her that my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt care if my legs have hair on them, he‚Äôs aware that women grow hair there. \\n\\nShe looks ridiculously disgusted by me. She‚Äôs giving me a nasty look and then says ‚Äúdo you at least make him dinner every night?‚Äù \\n\\nAt this point I‚Äôm nearly laughing. It was 2013 and are you kidding me? Why would I make him dinner nightly? So I tell her no way. Sometimes I make dinner for both of us but no way in hell do I make him food every night. She asks me why not, and I tell her because he is perfectly capable of getting off his ass and making himself some food. \\n\\nShe says, ‚ÄúWow, I‚Äôm surprised he hasn‚Äôt left you yet.‚Äù\\n\\nTo which I responded ‚Äúfuck off karen.‚Äù\\n\\nI ended up catching a plane home the next day because I didn‚Äôt want to be around her. I haven‚Äôt seen her since. \\n\\nRecently my mom told me that Karen is still mad I never apologized to her. I don‚Äôt feel I owe her an apology. AITA?\\n\\n\\nEdit: I didn‚Äôt expect this post to get so much attention. I just want to clear a few things up. \\n\\nI genuinely believed this post would get me a lot of ‚ÄúESH‚Äù and ‚ÄúYTA‚Äù. Some of you did say those things, one of you even called me a ‚Äúbratty teen‚Äù, but I‚Äôm shocked by the number of NTA. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt feel I owe Karen an apology, because she was unbelievably rude to me, but I do have a little guilt for swearing at an elderly woman and then just taking off the next day when I knew I was already on thin ice with her. \\n\\nMy family is really big into the ‚Äúrespect your elders‚Äù thing. It doesn‚Äôt matter if that elder is the worst person on the planet. We were punished if we didn‚Äôt respect those who were older than us, and therefore more important. So my telling her to fuck off was way beyond out of line. At least that‚Äôs what I was raised to believe. I don‚Äôt believe this now, but that‚Äôs the way it was. \\n\\nI asked this because I needed to know whether or not it was wrong of me to act the way I did to an elderly woman who I should have been treating with respect. \\n\\nSo to those of you calling me a validation seeker, I hope this clears things up for you a little. I still appreciate your input, because it makes it clear that it‚Äôs so obviously NTA in your eyes, that you think I‚Äôm just full of it. ',\n",

       " 'For context: we‚Äôve been dating for 1.5 years. Also for context, we‚Äôre both pretty private with our phones, her more than me.

We were cuddling and a name called ‚ÄúKen üòú‚Äù popped up on her phone on FaceTime. She tried to reject it really quickly but it seemed suspicious to me. I asked her who was that and she hesitated a moment before admitting it was her ex. This bothered me because we both don‚Äôt really say positive things about our exes, and I have no idea why he‚Äôd FaceTime (I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but video calling seems a lot more personal than phone calls or text messages). \\n\\nI asked her if she normally talks to her ex and she says no; they never talk, and doesn‚Äôt know why he called. I asked why was his name saved as that if she never talks to him, and she got annoyed and maintained that it was from when they were dating and she never deleted it. \\n\\nI asked her if she‚Äôd mind if I saw her text messages; not for everyone, just for that specific person. Or if I could look at her call logs. She looked at my like I had four eyes and was **PISSED**. She said that why do I want to go snooping on her phone? It‚Äôs a breach of privacy. I replied that I didn‚Äôt see it as snooping; it was just suspicious that a name she supposedly never talked to FaceTimed her, and it wouldn‚Äôt really take much to confirm her story. She restated that if I kept up acting crazy, I‚Äôd lose her, and I‚Äôm acting ridiculous. We fought, and as of now, we‚Äôre not speaking. \\n\\nI never really had a reason to not trust her, which is why I think I might be acting crazy. At the same time, it would‚Äôve taken a quick 5 second glance to confirm her story. As it stands, it just sounds sketchy, and I can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs just that private, or is hiding something. I would normally NEVER go through my partner‚Äôs phone without probably cause, but an ex FaceTiming you and the sketchiness just seemed weird. \\n\\nAITA for wanting to go through her phone?\\n\\nEdit: To add a little bit, we‚Äôve established early in the relationship that we‚Äôre not really on speaking terms with our ex. So that‚Äôs why I was suspicious. Because, we don‚Äôt talk to our exes, I would think there wouldn‚Äôt be much of a text conversation to read. I didn‚Äôt want to snoop through her whole phone; just wanted to see if they were communicating regularly.\\n\\nI see a bit of bickering in the comments soo to be clear, I **did** demand her.

Recently I was diagnosed with a very rare form of brain cancer and while we caught it early enough doctors believe I‚Äôm a high risk for relapse in the future. Essentially I have been given 15 years max to live. Recently I held a WIG party where my hardiresser and close friends brought in wigs and shaved my head. This is where the problem starts. Kat has been sucked into one of those essential oil MLM‚Äôs and has become somewhat of a soul sucking banshee but despite all that she‚Äôs been supportive of me in the past and she‚Äôs still my best friend. I‚Äôve dealt with her saying her oils could do better for me than chemo and telling me I‚Äôm just killing myself faster by not using her oils so I‚Äôve been close to my breaking point for awhile. I finally broke when Kat showed up without a wig or food but with a huge poster board of her MLM along with some of the products she sells. I of course started sobbing and all of our friends ripped Kat a new one. Kat has sent me some pretty nasty emails saying I‚Äôm not supportive and her mom has called my mom to scream about how ungrateful I am.

       " 'My daughter is 9 and just started going to a new school in January because we moved. It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason.\\n\\nAnyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not Chinese. You shouldn‚Äôt lie.‚Äù My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class.\\n\\nI was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. \\n\\nA few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a ‚Äútime out‚Äù for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. \\n\\nAt this point it was affecting my daughter‚Äôs enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they‚Äôre trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great.\\n\\nFlash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, ‚ÄúWell Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.‚Äù\\n\\nI was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me.\\n\\nI also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn‚Äôt feel bad.\\n\\nAITA though?

       " 'Okay so I‚Äôm 18 and this guy‚Äôs 44 j so y‚Äôall know \\n\\nBack in July 2018, he was my boss at this popular burger place I used to work at. Never really had a problem with him, but it was to my and my former co-worker‚Äôs recollection that he would always try and talk to me more than anyone else and gave me ‚Äúspecial treatment‚Äù such as offering to take me somewhere to eat after work and cleaned the fryers and grills when it was my turn. In September 2018, I gave him my two week‚Äôs notice due to slacking in school and my horrible shift hours which ruined my sleeping schedule (7pm-1am on weekdays, 7pm-3am on weekends). After my two weeks, he tried getting in touch with me by texting me. I‚Äôve never exchanged numbers with him, so I asked him how he got my number. Y‚ÄôALL. He got it from my job application. At first, I was weirded out but he was very nice and didn‚Äôt mean any harm. He knows my mom because she worked for him before I did, so one day he asked to come over to catch up with my mom and I. This turned into a every-other-week thing and he and I texted daily. I‚Äôve never flirted with him or anything because I‚Äôve never had any interest in someone who could be my father and the fact that he has kids (9f, 4m). Fast forward to today. He confessed his feelings for me via text and I honestly didn‚Äôt know how to respond. I instantly felt so uncomfortable. What could someone who‚Äôs 44 possibly see in someone who‚Äôs 18? To me, It‚Äôs pretty unorthodox. I always saw myself marrying someone no older than 25 and having my own kids. I respectfully rejected him and told him I saw him as a father figure. My dad isn‚Äôt in my life so it was nice to have someone like him to give me advice and wisdom. He didn‚Äôt like this, he told me he can‚Äôt help his feelings and that he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to keep them bottled up from me. I told him that I just don‚Äôt want him to overstep boundaries. He texted, ‚ÄúSo whatever I feel I should keep it locked up without showing at all?‚Äù I texted back, ‚ÄúYour feelings are not my problem. Take this rejection with dignity and learn from experience. Don‚Äôt continue to pursue me, that will show poor boundaries. Me not feeling the same way doesn‚Äôt mean there is something fundamentally wrong with you, I just don‚Äôt see you as my fit.‚Äù \\n\\nSo my question is, am I the asshole for saying that his feelings aren‚Äôt my problem?

He's on reddit more than me (first time posting, hi) so he will definitely see this. \\n\\nTo keep the story very short: I met him a year ago - he was my first real boyfriend (I'm f/late 20s) and told me around our 5th date that he had recently started becoming a furry. Wasn't a dealbreaker for me and I really liked him, so we continued dating.\\n\\nHe started getting more deeply into it, bought two really scary fursuits for 5400‚Ç¨ (glow-in-the-dark eyes, jesus), asked me to have sex in the suits. Again, I accepted. Personally, I'm not into this whole thing at all but he was and I liked him, so it was all okay on my front.\\n\\nAround our 6-month anniversary, he started to wear the fursuit pretty much all the time apart from work. That started annoying me because it was summer and super hot and more often than not I would end up having to sleep on the sofa because it got so hot in his bed. He got really upset about it and told me he needed me to buy a fursuit as well so we could be 'mates'. I declined (honestly, at that point it was mostly because I didn't have the money - I probably would have done it for him if he'd pestered my long enough).\\n\\nOur relationship got worse but then my friend from back home asked me and a whole bunch of friends to dinner since she'd recently had a baby. BF was obviously invited.\\n\\nHe wanted to go in the fursuit and I told him no. He told me I needed to accept him and not be ashamed of him and I told him that we had agreed he could do whatever he wanted in his or my apartment but not during meetings with my family and friends because most of them wouldn't get it and I especially didn't want to have to explain to my grannie and older relatives.\\n\\nHe accused me of not accepting him, of being an intolerant and racist 'cunt', for not accomodating him and getting a fursuit on my own etcetc. and then broke up with me.

I met her when I got a job here about 3 years ago and we hit it off. We were extremely close friends and I had misplaced trust in her. One thing she liked to do was take photos of us together and post them on snapchat and facebook. I never thought much of this and thought she was just sharing what we did like a normal person would do. I was wrong.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAbout a month ago a man randomly reached out to me. He claimed he was my \"girlfriends\" brother and that he had finally tracked me down. Through a long back and forth it turns out that my coworker has been pretending to her family and friends back in her home town that I was her boyfriend.

She claimed I was \"old fashioned\" and didn\\'t use social media to cover up her lie.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is fucking creepy, right? I documented and archived everything and corrected the record with her brother before reporting this all to HR. I didn\\'t feel like confronting her (I honestly didn\\'t feel like talking to her at all) and distanced myself immediately. She picked up on this quickly and started to post on her second facebook that I had broke up with her.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHR immediately transferred me away from her and kept us apart at all times. I\\'m guessing they told her what was going on as her facebooks disappeared over night and she began avoiding me like the plague.

This fake relationship stretched back 2 years and had very personal information and facts I shared with her in confidence along with very weird constructed situations she had made. One example was a picture I had sent to her while at home sick  she then turned into a dramatic story about how I was in the hospital and she was caring for me.

       " 'Hello reddit. I‚Äôm looking for an impartial view because I want to do what‚Äôs best for my son.\\n\\nMy 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the ‚Äúclass clown‚Äù and often disrupts class. I‚Äôve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I‚Äôve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.\\n\\nThe issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his ‚Äúbiggest‚Äù disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own ‚Äúsong,‚Äù even when the teacher said no.\\n\\nThe teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn‚Äôt in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route.\\n\\nI thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot.\\n\\nThis was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I\\'m of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I\\'m not anti-vax or anything, I just don\\'t like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).\\n\\nI ~~workin the healthcare field~~ am a healthcare consultant and interact with doctors often, and I genuinely don‚Äôt believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.\\n\\nMy son does annoying things, yes, but he\\'s a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don‚Äôt want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn‚Äôt mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function.\\n\\nSo reddit, AITA?\\n\\nTL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don‚Äôt want to put him on meds. AITA?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: The cognitive behavioral therapist thinks my son is making progress.

Out of the three people who saw him, two of them saw him once, while the other one is a ADHD specialist who seems to think CBT is working for his behavioral problems and that he doesn\\'t need medication. Additionally, that one sees him biweekly, is not fully convinced he actually has ADHD, and says he\\'s making great improvement (as noted by multiple times by his teachers). I already stated I planned to see another doctor (a ADHD-specialist neurologist; not a random psychiatrist that has complaints online).

       " \"Hello,\\n\\nThis is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/\\n\\nThis last month has been kind of wild for me so I haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. \\n\\nThis spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. \\n\\nAt the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. Que sera, sera. \",\n",
       " 'I was on a 14 hour flight recently sitting in coach. I am a tall guy and my legs are long and generally flying on airplanes is an overall extremely uncomfortable experience. I try to book seats with extra leg room on long flights such as exit seats or front row seats but there were none available when I was booking the flight. I used to only book aisle seats so I could intermittently stretch my legs out into the row but have had my knee smashed into by a cart and no longer take that approach. I would have even considered splurging on business class for such a long flight but those were all booked too.\\n\\nI\\'m sitting in my window seat and around two hours into the flight, the lady in front of me reclines her seat back around half way. This made me moderately more uncomfortable but I was OK with this as she paid for her ticket too and should be able to recline if she wants to. About 10 minutes later, she reclines her seat all of the way back essentially pinning my legs underneath her to the point where it was impossible to move them without hitting the back of her seat. Reclining my own seat back would not give me extra leg room based on how these seats were designed. I first attempt to readjust and slip my leg underneath to the space beneath her seat but this plane\\'s seat configuration was so cramped that I was unable to do that. Now, the readjusting of my legs to try and find a comfortable position was hitting the back of her chair. She turns around to me and says \"Can you stop that?\" and before I have a chance to answer lies back down, puts on her headphones and eyemask and turns around to go back to sleep.\\n\\nWell, I didn\\'t stop trying to adjust my leg as I wasn\\'t going to be able to tolerate being in significant pain and losing leg circulation for 12 hours. After a few more minutes of this, she gets up again, turns to me and says \"what are you doing? you need to stop kicking my chair\". I respond to her that the seat of her back is crushing my legs and I\\'m trying to adjust them into a comfortable position. She literally scoffs at me, then attempts to recline her back FURTHER despite it being at max recline, and goes back to sleep.\\n\\nThis significantly pissed me off so I began to move my leg more vigorously and this started to really rock the back of her chair. After about five minutes of this, she reclined her seat back up and went back to sleep. She did not recline it back for the rest of the flight.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nEdit: I think that I need to clarify a few things based on the responses I‚Äôve read.\\n\\n1. As I stated above, I generally try to book more comfortable seats for me way in advance. However nothing was available for the day I needed to fly out. Obviously, I would have picked any exit seat on any plane for that day but there were only a few flights for my location and nothing more comfortable was available. For anyone that thinks that I chose this seat ‚Äúfor my own convenience‚Äù, I don‚Äôt find 14 hours of torture a good time.  Furthermore, I‚Äôve been on plenty of flights in non extra leg room seats and have never been in a situation where my legs were this severely pinned even with the person in front in full recline. Usually I can just slide my legs under the seat in front of me but this specific plane seat did not allow for that as the space underneath did not have enough room for my legs.\\n\\n2. For everyone saying YTA because I decided to kick her seat to get my way, that is not what happened. She went into full recline and laid down on my legs. Realizing that I was unable to move my legs without brushing the back of her seat, I made as gentle of motions as possible to move my legs trying to not disturb her as much. There was no way that I could keep my legs completely still as it hurt and felt like I was losing blood supply and I was trying to find a position where that was not the case. After this dissatisfied her and she deliberately tried to crush me, I stopped caring about moving them gently and moved them freely to try to find a position. In no way was I purposely kicking her chair (though she may have deserved that after how she treated me) because that is clearly an asshole move and I wouldn‚Äôt be posting this question or using the term ‚Äúmore vigorously‚Äù instead of ‚Äúkick‚Äù. \\n\\n3. In hindsight, I agree that I should have complained to the flight attendant after I was deliberately crushed. However, I kind of wanted to avoid further confrontation because it was a full plane and I felt that the chances of me being able to move to a better or different seat were low. I have in the past always been able to find a position for my legs that works. If I was not able to, I would have complained to the flight attendant but by that point the lady in front of me had already put her back up.\\n ',\n",

My driver arrived quickly and the food was right, however:\\n\\nWhen he arrived and I opened my door, he smiled at me in a way that made me uncomfortable. I thanked him, quickly took my food, and closed and locked my door. Not even two minutes later I received a text message that said, verbatim, \"Hey u really pretty and I mean no disrespect but if you don\\'t have a man can we hang out sometime [personal phone number]\".\\n\\nI was immediately super uncomfortable, because as far as he knows I live alone and he has my address.

But a few of my other female friends and almost all of my male friends said I was an asshole, that I probably got him fired for it, and that it was him harmlessly shooting his shot.

It doesn\\'t matter either way.\\n\\nEdit2: to clarify this as well, the way he smiled at me when I opened the door was not friendly. It was not cordial. It reminded me of the way people smile at food. It was predatory and immediately made me nervous.',\n",
       " \"So I have been working in my parent's bar and grill/cafe for as long as I can remember. There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we are a grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

       " 'As the title suggests, I wanted to save two seats for my wife and 17-year-old son. Let me set the stage so that your decision can be rendered with all the facts:\\n\\nBWI to MHT, Sunday night (yesterday). Southwest flight... yes, I get the rules of boarding. For those that don\\'t know, SW boards in groups only and you don\\'t have assigned seating. You are simply assigned a group and then a number. Groups are A, B, and C and the numbers go from 1-65 (or so). If you are given A 25 you are typically the 25th person aboard the plane, give or take (but the exact numbers aren\\'t important here).\\n\\nOur meal was a little late prior to boarding so I went ahead and decided to board ahead of my family. As we have done countless times before, I\\'d just hold a couple of seats for them as I know they were right behind me. I had boarding letter/number A45. Southwest flies nothing but 737s with three variations. You either have 143 or 175 seats available. \\n\\nI sat down in an aisle seat and threw my jacket over the middle and window armrest. Two minutes later a young woman stopped at my seat, looked at me and said \"I want to sit there.\" pointing at the window seat. I politely said \"Oh, sorry, I\\'m trying to save these for my son and wife who are not far behind you. Her reply - \"So?\" I said \"But, 60% of the plane is still empty. You literally have the entire back half of the plan to sit wherever you want?\" \\n\\nShe moved her way in and that was that. Given the characteristics of the players involved, me uttering a single word would have lead to an international incident - that I am sure of. \\n\\nAITA for moving here? Should I have stood my ground? I get it - open seating. But the plan was, again literally, less than half full at this point. I have been flying for business for over 25 years. I\\'m quite sure that I have flown more than 85% or more of the general population. Not a fact I am proud of, just a little background to say that I know flying sucks, I know the rules and I also know that sometimes common courtesy supersedes some of the basic rules of boarding. \\n\\nI am also quite sure that this young lady feels that this was a major victory for the patriarchy, toxic masculinity, stupid old people... whatever battle she is waging (that nobody even knows she is involved in), but, seriously?\\n\\nTL;DR - Tried to save two seats (middle and window) on a Southwest flight for my family. More than half the plane was empty when someone pushed their way into seats that I was saving and I decided to take the high ground and just move.

My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women.

       " \"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)\\n\\nSo, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I‚Äôm not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\\n\\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She‚Äôs a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn‚Äôt and still don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn‚Äôt is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don‚Äôt know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \\n\\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn‚Äôt get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \\n\\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn‚Äôt even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I‚Äôm a Cornellian. I got in. I just don‚Äôt know how but I did. \\n\\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she‚Äôs been crying and solemn and sad. She‚Äôs been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She‚Äôs decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn‚Äôt been herself. I haven‚Äôt told our parents (I think they assumed I didn‚Äôt get in because she didn‚Äôt). \\n\\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it‚Äôs Cornell. I couldn‚Äôt in a million years imagine I‚Äôd get in. I‚Äôve been researching obsessively about it and I can‚Äôt shake the desire that if I don‚Äôt go, I‚Äôll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it‚Äôs a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \\n\\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don‚Äôt have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she‚Äôs worked compared to me...\\n\\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\\n\\nUPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. \\n\\nWell, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn‚Äôt I tell her earlier and she‚Äôs so proud of me\\n\\nBut seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...\\n\\nI going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.\\n\\nUpdate 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn‚Äôt know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update \\n\\nSo after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:\\n\\n> I‚Äôm sorry for how I reacted; please don‚Äôt be mad. I‚Äôm so happy for you and your accomplishments. It‚Äôs just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you‚Äôre going to be where I wanted to be and I‚Äôm just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm ranting I just need more time\\n\\nI‚Äôm not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I‚Äôm really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don‚Äôt stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we‚Äôre going to drift apart which would suck because we‚Äôre best friends and I just don‚Äôt want to lose my sister :(\\n\\nUpdate 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). \\n\\nThen they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.\\n\\nI stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.\\n\\nI still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.\\n\\nUpdate 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)\",\n",

I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn\\'t ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she\\'d stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she\\'s kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she\\'s kneeing really hard and I\\'m in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I\\'m dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn\\'t breathe and was choking. I\\'m thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she\\'s ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I\\'m going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she\\'s going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I\\'m recovering well.\\n\\nI told my friend about this the next day and she\\'s a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I\\'m a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn\\'t pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \\n\\nAITA?

When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\\n\\nI came back from work and she told me what happened...

That led to a host of appts at specialist and she took a leave from work to deal with it all. \\n\\nI work erratic hours and go to college so although I visited him at the hospital a few times.  I couldn‚Äôt make it to the appts. \\n\\nThe medical bills came rolling in and she asked me to help. I don‚Äôt have any more money so I told her no.

I can‚Äôt see him during the week because of my school schedule and work schedule so I told her no. The court order says nothing about medical bills and me having to pay half. \\n\\nNow she wants to enroll him in some kind of summer camp for kids with epilepsy because she said sending him to a regular daycare is hard since they often don‚Äôt know how to deal with his seizures.

I was slightly annoyed with her behavior but sort of forgot about it and tried to just enjoy everyone\\'s companies. Some time after that, when she was finished, she was out for more. She asked me to pass her this big plate of shrimp rice so that she could try some of that. That really struck me, but I didn\\'t want to argue right there and then, so what I did was get the srino rice and proceed to fill her plate up until it was literally overflowing a little bit.\\n\\nShe just kind of stared at it, then got up and went outside alone. Everyone was staring at me at this point and I thought it was better I just went outside too to talk to her.

My son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  Her children are 12 and 14.  \\n\\nPretty much since my son was born I‚Äôve put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  When I first started I was never able to add much to it, but I worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what I could.  It now has over $40k in it.  I‚Äôve been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  Still I‚Äôm proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  I‚Äôve daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend knew about the account. There have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  She was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   Now that my son will soon be graduating however we‚Äôve come to a point where we are unable move past.   She doesn‚Äôt want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. \\n\\nWe are a great team usually.  It‚Äôs almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  She‚Äôs fighting dirty too, she‚Äôs been making it out as if I don‚Äôt really love her children. At least not as much as my son.  I do love her kids.  That‚Äôs not in question, but the truth is of course I love my son more.  I feel like that shouldn‚Äôt even be that controversial of a thought.  I truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she‚Äôd never admit it. \\n\\nI honestly don‚Äôt even know if I would be able to split it up even if I chose too.  This is been something I broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  Even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  Inside there‚Äôs just a big ‚ÄúNO‚Äù feeling that comes up when I try to consider it. \\n\\nI also feel like it‚Äôs really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  Putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  In fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which I now help pay off) and I don‚Äôt particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. \\n\\nNeither of us have been backing down and it won‚Äôt be too much longer until it‚Äôs time to give him the money.

He said that they\\'ve made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. He said that by making that joke, all I have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. He wasn\\'t mad, just disappointed. He said that he would never make fun of me if I had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me I was beautiful no matter what. \\n\\nI felt really, really bad when he said that.

She sent a screenshot of a picture of herself that‚Äôs on Instagram page.\\n\\nI tried to push the conversation in a dirtier direction but she blocked me pretty quickly. She didn‚Äôt know it was me until today, when I told her that cheaters disgust me and that they should burn in hell and she‚Äôs lucky I love her enough to not immediately break up with her for what she did, sending a picture of herself in a bathing suit to some rando on Snapchat. She was angry at me for manufacturing an unrealistic scenario and believes she should have blocked the guy on Snapchat sooner, but that she did not cheat or imply that she would, especially because the photo she sent is public on her very well-followed Instagram. She‚Äôs also decided to fly home early for a few reasons (mostly because she‚Äôs unhappy with the job and very lonely) but that this was the thing that made her pull the trigger to come home early.\\n\\nAITA for considering what she did to be cheating and will probably break up with her? \\n\\nTL;DR: I catfished my long-distance girlfriend to see if she would cheat, and we disagree about if she did or not.',\n",

       " 'So, about 4 weeks ago my now ex girlfriend and I broke up. It wasn\\'t messy but we both agreed we weren\\'t right for each other. \\n\\nThe entire time we were dating she said she was on the pill. \\n\\nNow about 2 weeks ago she told me she was pregnant. And that she must\\'ve forgotten the pill once or it was during a cross over period of when she got back on the pill. I\\'m not really sure how it works, but I went to the doctors with her and we were told she was roughly 8 weeks.  \\nWe both sat down, spoke about it and agreed that termination was the best option as neither of us were ready for a child and it would be raised in a broken house to start with. \\n\\nAnyway this past week I\\'ve seen Snapchats of her drinking. I messaged her and said she shouldn\\'t be drinking while pregnant. \\nShe replied with \"why? We\\'re getting rid of it anyway\". \\n\\nI said it doesn\\'t matter, it\\'s still our child and whilst you\\'re pregnant you still shouldn\\'t be drinking. \\nThis didn\\'t sit well with her. She pulled the \"well you\\'re not my boyfriend\" card. \\n\\nAm I the asshole here? Does it really not matter? Or should I still be pissed.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nOkay, going to say a few things here because this is getting out of hand:\\n\\nIm not \"controlling\". Stop getting your knickers in a twist. I 100% UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS HER BODY AND HER CHOICE. I did not say she shouldn\\'t drink because I wanted to \"control\" her. I said it because it was a kneejerk reaction to \"hang on,drinking while pregnant is bad\". Stop pushing an agenda on this specific detail and taking it WAY out of proportion.\\n\\nSecondly, not a SINGLE SANE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL would say that drinking while pregnant is a safe or smart move. The amount of people here who seem to be okay with this is astounding.\\n\\nThirdly, Not that it matters one bit, but, we broke up because we had NO COMMON INTERESTS. I actually suggested we break up. She said she wasn\\'t really feeling it either. It was easy, it was mutual and there was no argument. We just, didn\\'t like any of the same things, didn\\'t have any of the same hobbies, we tried to find something we could do as a couple to be \"our thing\", and we couldn\\'t. Sometimes things just don\\'t work out.\\n\\nFourth(ly?), she has suggested getting back together since the pregnancy, only last week. I said to her, kindly and respectfully that this would be a bad decision, and that she\\'s only saying this because she misses having someone there, and that in the future she will find someone who is a better fit for her, then myself. \\n\\nFifth(ly?), I actually want the mods to remove this. Not because of the obviously overwhelming \"YTA\" posts, but because there are comments going back and forth to myself, and other redditors that do NOT help, educate or provide any purpose to the conversation what-so-ever. It has gotten out of hand. I have received personal messages of abuse (fuck off, please.), and personal messages of support from people who cant be assed commenting here because they know they\\'ll just get instantly downvoted and have people hurling messages at them for simply stating their own opinion. \\n\\nMy Ex and I have had talks since this argument. About lots of things. There is no hate between us. There is no tension. We are getting along just fine. I told her from day 1 of finding out she is pregnant, that the choice is hers. That if she chooses to keep the baby then I will stick around as a father. But I laid out to her my thoughts on the situation in an adult way and she did so as well, which is why we came to the conclusion we did. \\nPeople do seem to forget that people change their minds all the damn time. This is NOT black and white. She MAY turn around and say she wants to keep the baby, in which case, I HAVE TO SUPPORT that decision because yes it is HERS to make. However that would also make me the father, and I will not just dissapear in the event of her keeping the baby. I do not believe in running from something like that. So yes, I would appreciate she did not drink until the abortion is done. The abortion is booked in for the 12th. 6 days from now. She found out about the pregnancy a week before she told me, so this would put her at just on 4 weeks from the date she found out, to the termination (assuming she doesn\\'t change her mind). \\nWe do live in Australia. No, apparently it\\'s not free. She said its still going to cost. I offered to be there for her during it, and to pay the entire bill. She said she didn\\'t want me there and that she didn\\'t want me to pay and that this is something she feels she needs to do alone. I respect this, however I am only a message away if she needs the support. \\n\\nI should not need to go into this much detail about the whole situation, and quite frankly I am disgusted in the amount of people being okay with a pregnant woman drinking. If a medical professional wouldn\\'t recommend it, then it\\'s probably not okay.',\n",

The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \\n\\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \\n\\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life.

       " 'My best friend of 15 years hopped on the antivax movement a couple of years ago. Obviously this has caused a few arguments in the past, but for the most part we avoid the topic because she knows how much it bothers me. \\n\\nSo last week we got on the topic of kids and she said ‚ÄúObviously I wouldn‚Äôt get them vaccinated‚Äù which even though I knew how she felt about it, really really upset me. So I responded with ‚ÄúI might not be able to change your mind, but if you don‚Äôt vaccinate your kids then they‚Äôre not allowed to play with mine.‚Äù \\n\\nAs soon as I said that she went off about how I would be irresponsible for getting them vaccinated and how it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to the kids to prevent them from playing with each other just because I didn‚Äôt agree with her. I told her that at that point they would pose a risk to my children and just because she was willing to risk her kids lives because of her stupid reckless opinion doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to. It got really heated and obviously didn‚Äôt end well.\\n\\nEver since then, she‚Äôs been spamming me with phony articles supporting her views all citing no existent studies and spouting the same bs. I just ignored her and honestly didn‚Äôt feel like I did anything wrong until a few of our mutual friends messaged me saying ‚ÄúYou guys don‚Äôt even have kids, just let it go.‚Äù And ‚ÄúWould you really isolate your kids just because you disagree with her‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre would vaccinate your kids anyway, there would be no health risk to them.‚Äù Completely missing the point. \\n\\nThese friends messaging me all disagree with anti vaxxers, but are acting like I‚Äôm an awful person. AITA? Should I just drop it?\\n\\n\\nEDIT: I feel like I need to defend my friend here, she‚Äôs not and inherently stupid person. She‚Äôs actually normally very intelligent and we tend to agree on most things, the things we don‚Äôt we can normally still have a civil conversation about. This is just the exception and the seriousness of the topic tends to get us both very worked up. \\n\\nIt wasn‚Äôt a question about whether you agree with anti vaxxers or not, I know most people‚Äôs opinions on that. The question was in this situation, should I just let it go because it‚Äôs a hypothetical even though it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm very passionate about. I love my friend, she‚Äôs been my best friend for 15 years and we‚Äôve never really had issues like this before. I don‚Äôt want to just drop her. I understand the passionate responses, but I didn‚Äôt want people hating on her. Hating on the ani vax movement is fine, but I didn‚Äôt make this post so people would hate on her.\\n',\n",
       " \"To start, the cast of characters is me and my older coworker (late 50s).  As background, she is not in the same department as me, but we work on some projects together.  In our shared projects, she is technically my subordinate - but I try to view it as a collaboration.  We are friendly and laugh together and get along, but we have never had lunch together or see each other outside of work.\\n\\nNow that the context has been laid out, onto the story.  The other day she came to work with a very cool hair style.  (She always has cool hairstyles.)  The underside of her hair was dyed in a rainbow fashion.  As we were passing each other in the hall, we greeted each other and I commented that I liked her hair while casually indicating the colors - but by actually touching her hair.  She thanked me and we continued on our way.  I didn't think much of it, until another coworker caught me at the end of the hall and told me it was wrong and you aren't supposed to touch a black woman's hair.  I didn't know that there was etiquette involved and I feel really bad, especially if she only tolerated the action because I'm more senior.  So, was I the asshole? \\n\\nEDIT: ok. I‚Äôm the asshole. But just to clarify some things since a lot of people are reading actions in my post that didn‚Äôt happen. I did not stroke, caress, run my fingers through, pull, pet, or yank her hair, as a lot of commenters said I did. \\n\\nAs I was pointing my finger for a brief second (less than a second really) grazed her hair. I can‚Äôt say the moment was an accident, but it is not like I was interested in actually touching her hair to feel it. I was pointing at one part of her hair because she had a very intricate hair style and I was pointing at the colored part. \\n\\nNow, obviously, I need to be in better control and not let myself get that close again as people don‚Äôt like it. Although, as I said, she didn‚Äôt react to the touch at all and we continued chatting. \\n\\nTouching other people is probably something I will have to work on in general as I‚Äôm a touchy feely person. So, no, in answer to some of you, I don‚Äôt mind if people touch me. And they do. When I was pregnant people touched my belly. It didn‚Äôt bother me. Oh well. Lesson learned. \",\n",
       " 'I am a 53 years old father and have a 19 year old daughter. She\\'s in her second year of college vying for computer science, but still a pre-major as she finishes her core credits.\\n\\nAt home, she\\'s been on her computer for an average of 10 or 8 hours a day when she doesn\\'t have class or work. As soon as she comes home she logs on saying she has homework to do, but when I usually check in it looks like my daughter is playing a game and typing in chat. I don\\'t know that much about computers, but I don\\'t understand why every assignment needs a computer or laptop. I also know she\\'s interested in video games so I know she plays them from time to time.\\n\\nI think she\\'s been spending too much time on her computer so I put curfews on her usage and began taking her laptop at night to make sure she heads to bed instead of playing games. She\\'s tried to make excuses to why she needs her computer but I don\\'t believe that absolutely every assignment needs a computer, else why would she still need to buy textbooks? And she\\'s getting fatter by being online and sitting so much.\\n\\nMy wife and younger daughter are saying I\\'m being unreasonable but I don\\'t understand how setting a limit to technology can be a bad thing in this age. AITA?\\n\\nedit for common questions: She is not failing classes but her time spent with the family has drastically dropped. I pay for her schooling and paid for her computer AFTER she initially raised enough money to get it on her own (I bought it as a reward so she could keep the money). She lives with us as her school is too close to reasonably use a dorm and I don\\'t see a point in helping her get a place of her own to worry about bills when she must focus on school.\\n\\nedit: Daughter has seen this post. We are going to sit down for discussion. Update tentative.\\n\\nedit: Please stop sending me harmful DMs.\\n***\\n**UPDATE:** In the time that passed, my daughters and I sat down for a discussion. My wife didn\\'t want to sit in. She has seen the post and hasn\\'t spoken to me extensively to it yet, other than saying after the discussion with my daughter\\'s that she feels she has failed as a mother in letting the both of them feel like they are trapped at home. We have not talked further.\\n\\nIt turns out my 17 year old (Amy) found my post and showed it to her sister (Zoe) whom I originally posted about, and was much more emotional about it than her. They prepped arguments. They were both explaining they think I was out of line and disrespectful for multiple things in what I said in both the OP and in the comments. After hearing what they had to say I agreed. They demanded I apologized and I did.\\n\\nZoe showed me programs on her laptop that she explained were either class sites, code work, and other related things. That and other comments from the previous post plus private conversations helped put things in perspective of how much workload is reliant on her computer and access to internet. I asked to see her grades and saw that some classes were hovering in the 80-70% grade. Her university requires at least 75% to pass the class, so it was possible that she was failing. Zoe says that she has had less time to work on school due to work. I wanted to voice being disappointed but Amy interrupted me and asked me to please listen. She\\'s visibly upset and not the kind to speak loudly, which was surprising.\\n\\nZoe confessed she started working to get herself money to buy things and save for things like recently, another laptop she can claim full ownership to, and for renting an apartment to move out to with Amy, with absolutely no financial help from me to get their own place to stay. They live at home, so that hasn\\'t happened. With Zoe\\'s current job\\'s payrate and the work she has at school anyway, it wouldn\\'t have been possible to move, but the intent they had was hard to hear as it confirmed many comments from the previous post. For reference, Zoe started to work when she was 15. However, Zoe has made 0 effort to contribute to house bills pays for nothing such as the internet, the car she uses right now, the water, heating, etc. She is an adult but hasn\\'t paid for any utilities, speaking as if she were a tenant. I said if she made more contributions to bills then I would be less strict on rules.\\n\\nZoe spoke about her cousin. She has said that when their older cousin (whom my daughters are very close to) found out that she and Amy were never taught how to budget money, had a word with my wife and then taught my daughters how to save their money and to get things like credits cards. I\\'ve never known about them having credit cards before. When Zoe asked her cousin how to start moving out and doing what she says are \"adult things\", their cousin gave her guidelines in what look for in apartments, the payment plans, or just starting smaller in getting a car. She quoted her cousin and said that she believes they both should have been taught these things much earlier. I don\\'t appreciate how their cousin (supposedly) spoke about how and when my daughters should be taught things but see their point.\\n\\nWe eventually came to a compromise. The previous living conditions (must stay in the house through college for help in moving out later) was dropped. Zoe no longer has her laptop or computer privileges taken away, but I am adamant that she has to be in bed by 1am or it\\'ll be forced off. If she can lose 30lbs then there will be no curfew. She gave me an attitude but eventually agreed to the conditions, which I thought were plenty fair. They ended saying they respect me, but don\\'t love me. That\\'s where we stand.\\n\\nNow, my family has yet to have a meal together. My daughters go out together while my wife makes something for herself and leaves me to my own devices. Though it\\'s not uncommon for us to not sit together, it feels like this is on purpose. I\\'m unsure where to go from here.',\n",

       " 'I have 2 children, a high school senior and a high school sophomore. The Missus is a cardiac surgeon while I work as a software engineer at a pretty big firm. Needless to say, finances aren‚Äôt an issue for us.\\n\\nNow I‚Äôm of the opinion that my kids‚Äô primary focus should be their education right now. They don‚Äôt have/need jobs (besides sometimes part-time during the summer), but the wife and I pretty much pay for everything. As such, the kids just expected that we would pay for their college, which honestly, was a reasonable expectation. The problem lies with our daughter: she wants to major in Comparative Literature or something related to writing. Her reasoning is that she loves writing and she‚Äôs good at it.\\n\\nI‚Äôm a bit hesitant to just pay for unconditional college. If her goal was to be a writing professor, or just had a specific career goal in mind in general, I‚Äôd be a lot more willing. But as it stands, her primary motivator was just because it interests her. I told her that I‚Äôm fine paying for education, on the condition that she majored in something more ‚Äúpractical‚Äù. Or that if she had a legitimate plan to get from what she‚Äôs majoring to what she wants to do, then I‚Äôd be happy to pick up the tuition and living expenses, which means she just needs to pay for her own food.

She‚Äôs using this information from the past to claim I‚Äôm trying to manipulate her into doing a field that I want her to do.\\n\\nMy POV is, I don‚Äôt necessarily care if she does a field in STEM. She can get her Underwater Basket Weaving degree IF she planned to, for example, be a lawyer (and thus has an actual use for the degree), but she can‚Äôt just major in something because she ‚Äúlikes‚Äù it.

First, if the child is mine, I will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. We will never get back together. The moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. Secondly, I will not interact with you at all until the child is born. Don't reach out to me until then, I want nothing to do with you. Finally, I will not have ANY role in the kid's life - nor will I sign any birth certificate - until I get a paternity test.

She doesn‚Äôt want vegan cupcakes though I am going to make some for her some time anyways so she can see how good they can be. I can‚Äôt afford to make both vegan and non vegan food (mainly because it‚Äôs so much more expensive to make the vegan stuff to begin with though.)\\n\\n******Important Disclaimer: Please don‚Äôt use my stupid idea to degrade vegans. This has nothing to do with the ideology of veganism and everything to do with the fact that i wanted to eat cupcakes at a party.

Most of the other guests enjoyed it and my husband said he couldn't even tell the difference. Some of my friends said it was my fault for not telling everyone on the invite that it would be all vegetarian.

       " ' My husband and I began looking at getting away from the city a few years ago. We had a small checklist: husband wanted permanent running water, I wanted a house. We looked at many properties before we stumbled across this one by a fluke. It has two permanent creeks and a small house and is absolutely perfect. The property runs adjacent to a national park so it will always remain secluded. We both instantly fell in love and even though it was quite out of our budget, our parents both loved it as well and helped us purchase it. The property itself is almost 100 acres and is the very last house on the dirt road. (Also, I should mention that the seller of the property was an elderly man who only used this place as a weekender and owned his permanent home in the city)\\n\\nOne of the main things that drew us to this place is the permanent creeks. They are full of swimming holes and one of the best ones even had a rope tied to the tree. Real estate agents said that a few local kids had used it because previous owner was never there and didn‚Äôt mind. \\n\\nThe road turns into an easement to get to the national park entrance and the creek line is the boundary of our property to the national park. The swimming hole in question is about midway between the easement and our house. Over the years, this swimming hole has become well known to the locals and there is a path that has been made to get to this swimming hole that is on our property.  \\n\\nWe certainly didn‚Äôt like the idea of strangers walking so near the house so Husband puts up a wire fence across the path and a no trespassing sign. Within days of putting it up, a woman walks around the fence and to our house to yell at us saying that she has been walking this path and swimming for 30 years. We politely tell her that it is private property and just because the old owners didn‚Äôt mind doesn‚Äôt mean we do as well. Less than a week after this incident, somebody posts about the fence in our local suburb Facebook group and while many people were angry, many understood as well. We‚Äôre not asking people to not swim. We don‚Äôt own the water, we‚Äôre just asking people to go to the national park side to access the swimming hole (because we DO own right up to the waters edge). However, about another week later, our sign is stolen and the wire fence is cut. We have made it very clear what our reasoning is. We purchased this property for privacy and so far, people are more invasive than if we had purchased in the city. Just today, I was out mowing (we haven‚Äôt replaced the sign or fence yet) and 3 girls come walking from this path and walk directly across the front paddock, essentially our front yard. Am I the A-hole for wanting to protect my privacy? \\n\\nTldr; The access to a really awesome swimming hole, that has been used for generations, is on our property and we don‚Äôt want people trespassing to get to it.\\n\\nEdit: I tried to sketch the layout.

I have been very trusting with her and agreed to let her live in the dorms even though the university is well within driving distance. As a result she is open with me. A while back, Lauren came to me saying she wanted to go on the pill. I asked her why and she hesitantly told me that her and her boyfriend (he's 15, not some college boy thank God) were having sex and they used protection, but she didn't want to risk getting pregnant. I wanted to scream. The girl is 14. I sat her down and told her that I was happy she came to me and that she could go on the pill, but I didn't think she was emotionally mature enough for sex. She argued that if she was emotionally mature enough for college she was emotionally mature enough for sex, that it was her body and I couldn't do anything about it. I disagree.

She said okay and walked away. Lauren living at school makes it impossible for me to enforce rules and follow through on punishments. Lauren and I hardly ever butt heads so this has never been a problem before. I can track her phone all I want but she could just leave it in her dorm and that's exactly what happened. I found out that she was going behind my back and going to her boyfriend's. I've thought about talking to his parents but from what I can tell they're pretty apathetic. WIBTA if I make her move back home and ground her unless she can agree to abide by my rules? She would still be attending classes, the college is half an hour away and our city has an excellent public transportation system.\",\n",

Fortunately, my son has a private little corner of our backyard where he can go relieve himself in emergencies, but it can be torture for myself or any other women stuck waiting to tinkle. \\n\\nOne time it got so bad, I had to take my neice all the way back to her house only to find it locked up tight. So we came back and I almost beat the door down till he finally, graciously, relinquished the bathroom.

I have finally got him to where he will unlock the door before he jumps in the shower so we can at least get in to relieve ourselves.\\n\\nAnd it has going on for years! I remember being on maternity leave, and being so resentful that he would come home and dissapear for an hour or so while I waited with our newborn.

       " 'My cat, Midnight, is about 12 years old. She is, and has always been, one of the sweetest cats I own. Like curls up on my chest under the blankets, licks my cheek, and purrs herself to sleep. I\\'ve had her for almost 10 years, and she is my baby. \\n\\nShe\\'s very nervous around others because, before coming to me, her previous owner abused her and tried to drown her in a river. So she\\'ll usually hide under a bed or a couch when my boyfriend and I have company. She may come out if our friends are quieter or if we\\'re not moving around much. \\n\\nA friend of ours came by today with her son, about 7 years old. He knows we have cats. Our other cat (Rocky) is a ham. He\\'s a huge fluffy cat that loves people. He will approach anyone and flop across you as long as you pet him. So when her son asked where the cats were, we directed him to Rocky but he said he wanted to see Midnight. I explained that she\\'s shy, so she\\'s hiding.\\n\\nShortly after, I watched her come barrelling out of the bedroom and into the corner of the kitchen. So I scooped her up, and she was shaking. My friend\\'s son ran out after her, laughing. I told him again that she\\'s shy, and now she\\'s scared. I warned him that if she gets scared (she is a very small cat), she might scratch him to protect herself and that he should leave her alone. \\n\\nI put her back in my room and shut the door. I told my friend what I had told him, and she took him into the backyard with my bf so he could start grilling up lunch. At some point, her kid came back inside while I was cooking, and went into my room. He ended up cornering Midnight, and in self-defense, she scratched him. And since he had his face near her, she got him good down the side of his face. He started screaming and crying and told his mom that my cat attacked him.\\n\\nMy friend was furious because her son was so badly hurt (I will admit, it did look painful, I think he pulled away while she was scratching and her claws got caught in his skin). She said that if I didn\\'t get my \"vicious\" cat put down or declawed, she was going to sue us for her kid\\'s medical bills/medicine/etc. \\n\\nI didn\\'t even pretend to consider either option. Declawing is cruel, and I\\'m not putting down my baby for protecting herself after I warned him AND separated her. But my neighbors (who heard the commotion and came over to check on everyone) insisted that, no matter how sweet my cat was before, she seriously injured a child and that \"something needs to be done.\"\\n\\nAITA for refusing to declaw or put down my cat?\\n\\nEdit: Pictures were requested! They\\'re mostly Midnight, but the big boy in one of them is Rocky!\\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/cbCuplB\\n\\nUpdate: I texted her husband earlier to check on how the little guy was doing. He saw the doctor yesterday after they left-- there was no sign of infection, he was utd on his tetanus, they were told to get some Neosporin and keep it clean. No damage to his eye. The husband asked if Midnight was doing okay (everyone who knows her knows how skittish she can be). He assured me that he had a talk with his kid abour respecting animals and respecting the rules in another person\\'s house. I did tell him that I wasn\\'t comfortable with them coming here for the time being, and he understood. Friend is still angry because she still thinks my cat should have been trained better than to scratch someone in self defense. She\\'s dropped the \"I\\'m suing\" line, but she still thinks I should declaw my cat, which I made very clear I will not do. \\n\\nAlso Midnight has been so overjoyed by all the extra snuggles today. Thank you all so much for your advice. I reached out to a friend who is a lawyer, who offered to help pro-bono if it does get taken to court, but he\\'s fairly certain it won\\'t. Thank you all so much for your advice and reassurances. <3\\n\\nUpdate 2: She is continuing to insist my cat be declawed for her son\\'s safety in case they ever go over again. So today I told her she and her son are no longer welcome in my house. She found that unacceptable and hung up on me. Safe to say, I believe this friendship is over.',\n",

He‚Äôs been out for about 4 years and now has 2 children from his current girlfriend - a 3 year old son and a newborn girl. Both my brother and his gf were tested for drugs at the hospital (I‚Äôm guessing because the baby girl must have been tested) and they both came up positive and had custody taken away. My mother has decided to not pursue custody because she can‚Äôt afford it plus she is older and disabled and can‚Äôt handle anymore children, especially small ones. His gf‚Äòs mom tried to get custody but she wasn‚Äôt deemed fit herself so right now both the kids are in foster care. Gf also had two other kids, their father has custody. He (understandably) does not want to pursue custody of these two. Both my mother and my brother have begged me to take custody of the kids and I‚Äôve been very firm in my refusal. I have 4 children of my own, i work full time, and I have no room in my home for them to live comfortably. I would not be able to afford childcare for them and I cannot afford to quit my job to be a stay at home parent for whatever length of time I would have them for.  My husband is completely behind me on this. They are the ones who made the decision to do drugs, it‚Äôs not my responsibility to raise their kids now that they‚Äôve been taken away. However, my mother vehemently disagrees (to the point of name calling) and believes that since she‚Äôs taken the older 3 that I should take the other 2 so that they can continue to be raised by family and all the siblings can still grow up together. I already barely speak to my mother because of childhood trauma, and this is making me feel like it would be best to sever ties completely but before I do I wanted to make sure that I am in the right and that I don‚Äôt have a responsibility to my brother and his children. I truly believe that these babies would be far better off being adopted into loving stable families, even if my brother gets custody back (it‚Äôs doubtful given the fact he never did the work to get the older 3 back), i doubt they will ever live a normal healthy life. And would it be fair to upend my own children‚Äôs life for this? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong, but i have a predisposition to feel guilt where there is none and my mother knows that. I‚Äôm on this subreddit a lot and figured this would be the perfect group of people to weigh in. Am I the asshole here?',\n",

X is one of the most good-looking but also the most outgoing, friendly guy I know, and everybody loves him. But the first time my boyfriend met him, he was so uneasy around X. He blushed a little when X jokingly flirted with him, then stuck close to me. The whole evening, he was so nervous and awkward, I had never seen him like that before.

I believe he is getting most of his bigoted views from the internet. So I got my brother to put parental controls on his tablet, phone, and computer. He can only access very select sites and basically ask permission for a website to be unblocked. He screamed and told me I was being unfair called his dad (we‚Äôre divorced). He told me I was being unreasonable. His father his a drug addict and alcoholic, and I don‚Äôt really care for what he has to say. But it made me wonder if I was being an asshole to my son.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: For some reason, people are thinking I\\'ve never said a word to him about this views he\\'s expressing. I have. He just thinks it\\'s a difference in political views and don\\'t think it\\'s a big deal. He compares it to commenting on /r/SandersForPresident. I told him thinking difference politically is one thing, but he\\'s young and impressionable, and the content he\\'s viewing is how neo-nazis are born. He just chalks it up to a difference in opinion and it goes no where.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso, he doesn\\'t think he\\'s racist at all. He thinks people infantilize black people and they can succeed if they really want to. That if blacks and whites are truly equal, there\\'s no reason why blacks should have an advantage regarding schools, jobs, etc to meet a quota.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI got a couple of comments that complained about how I was able to create this account if I\\'m new to Reddit, but I\\'ve been using Reddit for months now.

Please? \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI've been with my girlfriend (we'll call her Molly) for about 4 years, lived together for 3. Earlier last year our 17 year old cat lost her battle with cancer. I've had cats my whole life and adopted her as a senior before meeting Molly. Molly never had cats before but adored her, and started talking about adopting immediately. About six months later in December she found a youngish (7mos?) feral male who got a nasty-but-recoverable injury sleeping under a car hood. She fell in love immediately and so did I. I tried to give her the benefit of my experience and told her that this isn't going to be the same as adopting an adult cat who already has a sweet personality, and this kitten will require a lot of patience. She said she understood and we started foster-to-adopting him as soon as the vet gave us the go-ahead. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI still love him, but he's highlighted every single thing that's been keeping us from getting engaged. For one, Molly refuses to listen to him. He growls, he hisses at her. She started yanking him out of his carrier so often that he's afraid to go in there now. She doesn't listen to ME when I try to explain what she could do to get him to warm up to her. She keeps bringing up examples of people she knows who got a cat to like them this way. I work at home, and he's a completely different cat when I'm home and she isn't.  He plays and sits in the window when it's just me and runs under the bed the second she gets home and only comes out to eat. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI've suggested to her that we need to start seriously thinking about finding him another home before he gets too old and too scared. Every single time I bring it up she accuses me of being callous and giving up on him too easily, and how she never knew pets were so disposable to me. They're not, but she's not a good fit for him. So at this point I'm beginning to think that his best shot is me breaking up with her and taking this poor cat with me.  Our relationship isn't that solid but I think it might be fixable if it wasn't for this, but he's a living being and deserves to be happy too. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ntl;dr: My girlfriend and I adopted a cat and she makes him miserable.

       " 'TL;DR - My daughter is spoiled and doesn\\'t know the value of a dollar. We\\'re thinking of \\n\\nMy daughter is 13, almost 14 - let\\'s call her Tara. I\\'ve come to realize that she is somewhat spoiled. We (my husband and I) are very well off and have given her a good lifestyle; throughout her and her sibling\\'s childhoods, we made sure to make sure our children know that they are very lucky and that we will not provide for them forever. However, it seems that Tara doesn\\'t quite understand the value of a dollar yet and refuses to recognize how much of a privilege it is to have a huge house in a safe neighborhood, private schooling, a cellphone, etc. \\n\\nI haven\\'t yet given a punishment to her yet, but it is on the table (and she knows it). For the past few months, she\\'s been acting like a spoiled brat. In February, she destroyed a very nice dress we bought for a school dance and was mad because \"It\\'s not like you guys can\\'t afford another one.\" For that, we made her do extra chores as a mock job until she repaid the value of the dress (and she did not get another). In March, Tara complained to her father that she didn\\'t want him to drop her off at school anymore because it isn\\'t as expensive and fancy as the others in the car lot (he drives a 2013ish Volvo and her friend\\'s parents have Jaguars and BMWs); she had to walk 2 miles to everyday for a week for that. \\n\\nThis past Thursday was the worst offence yet. I\\'m still seething. She was being foolish at school and somehow broke her phone AND someone else\\'s. Now, the other girl in question is a close friend of Tara\\'s, so I don\\'t suspect any bullying, but I am still enraged at how she handled the situation. She apparently told her friend not to worry because we (her father and I) would pay for it. We had a nice, long chat about this last night about what happened; after a little digging, I realized Tara just isn\\'t appreciative of what her father and I have provided her with. We\\'ve had multiple discussions about it, but I don\\'t feel she truly gets it.\\n\\nSo far we have 3 options:\\n\\n* Take away her phone and other expensive tech away for the next month. \\n\\n* Have her get a job doing yardwork/babysitting around the neighborhood until she can pay the equivalent of her phone bill\\n\\n* Have her spend the summer at an uncle\\'s house in a middle class neighborhood close to an impoverished area, where she\\'ll do volunteer service at the local shelter every week. She will also have to have a job.\\n\\nThe last one is the most brutal, as it means she can\\'t go on a girls trip with her BFFs - a (very expensive) trip she\\'s gone on every summer for the past 2-3 years. I\\'m definitely a proponent of it, however, as she NEEDS to know how lucky she is and MUST gain some real world knowledge (considering my husband and I will only cover college tuition, not anything else, after she leaves the nest). My husband, however, feels it is a little cruel; he feels like we would have to ease her into conditions that \"shocking.\"',\n",

I really liked the AK-47 he had, just something about it totally drew my eye. So I complimented on it. He asked if I wanted it. I told him to stop joking with me. He said he wasn\\'t joking at all and that he would give it to me for always being so nice to him. I told him about my bonus money and he said well to be fair he\\'d sell it to me for $200. I was like cool. So I went from never even holding a gun in my entire life to now i\\'m the proud freaking owner of an AK-47! My friend is going to take me shooting with it on Wednesday afternoon and I\\'m so excited. \\n\\nSo I just got off shit and my sister and roommate are furious with me. They say it should have been implied that we never bring guns into the house. I told them we never talked about it. They both said exactly and basically \"banned\" me from bringing my gun into the house. Which to me is utter bullshit because I pay rent as well and I have the right to have whatever I want as long as it\\'s legal in my space.  \\n\\nThe both are furious with me.

My parents divorced when I was 3 and I grew up in a very unstable and negative environment. Above a specific career or any other life achievement I have aspired to be both a dad and a husband. I want my kids to grow up in a loving household I never had. Furthermore I have always had a passion for kids between helping raise my half sisters, spending time with my little cousins, babysitting, and as lately hanging out with my 1 year old nephew.  As I said she knows I am passionate, I am an open book and wear my heart on my sleeve. \\n\\nA few more lines of dialogue were exchanged in the car. I tried to explain myself and she told me I didn‚Äôt care about her. Then we arrived back at my place.\\n\\nShe got out of the car crying her eyes out saying she was leaving. I asked her if we were breaking up, she said yes. Then she got in her car and left before we could even sit down to actually talk.\\n\\nI wish we could have had that talk.

And it took almost that full time to let it sink in what I‚Äôve really done. I self wallowed for some time and attempted to guilt trip her and get my siblings to talk to her for me. What a mistake that was. She called and ripped me a new one worse than you guys did. She told me that she was thrilled we‚Äôre not together and that I‚Äôm manipulative and ‚Äúdisgusting.‚Äù That left me really shocked and I had to review my behavior over the time we had been together. I think over my life I always had an idea that with enough perseverance anyone‚Äôs mind can be changed. I don‚Äôt know where I got this from. I guess I thought it was a sign of being a strong person. Like taking what you want from life even when the chances are slim. It sounds stupid because it is. I reread my post just now and cringed the whole way through. Even the language I used showed that she was right and I am manipulative. She‚Äôs a human being and I didn‚Äôt treat her with respect. I played with our relationship to get her to change her mind about something very important to her. I deserve what happened. I also have realized that our views on the relationship were a little different. She had never brought up marriage or anything while it had crossed my mind almost daily because I really was so enamored. So I probably looked insane going on about having three children. It sounds so stupid to me now. Among the things she said on the phone, one was that she found my lack of respect for her body and choices appalling. I wasn‚Äôt asking her to be forgiven, but I wanted to express how much her and her son meant to me. And as most dumped people tend to do, I couldn‚Äôt even give a shit about what I was bitching about in the first place. I miss going to the park with her and her son. Those days were nice and calm and I didn‚Äôt appreciate them. I let some fictional children and my bad habits ruin something good. I have a lot of self reflecting to do, and while I‚Äôm still sad, I know now that her dumping me was really for the best. Thanks guys for being honest.\\n\\ntldr: we didn‚Äôt get back together and I‚Äôm the asshole.',\n",
       " \"So for a bit of context, my GF has claimed to be sick for the past couple of days, but that hasn't stopped her from going out with friends or work.\\n\\n\\nIn the morning I began cleaning both our bathrooms and the kitchen and asked if my GF would help. She declined because she was sick, I was fine with this and continued on my way. After I just finished mopping, the tap and our laundry broke and wouldn't turn off. I could tell it was just a washer that needed replacing, but because it was more of a drizzle instead of a drip I turned the water and started to replace it.\\n\\n\\nWe recently moved into this apartment and I wasn't familiar with the plumbing in the laundry, so it took me a while to figure out how to get the tap off and replace the washer. While this was happening my GF was questioning my ability to change the washer, even though Id done it tons of times at my old place. I was becoming irritated at this and she kept nudging me to get a plumber to do it... On a Sunday. I kept telling her once I got the tap off it will be a simple job but she wouldn't stop pestering me about it. Anyway I fixed the tap without a plumber and went to sit down.\\n\\n\\nSo half the day is gone, I have assignments to do for uni, and I only just sat down for the first time today when she began asking me to do all these other trivial things that didn't need to be completed right now. I was kinda ignoring her because I just want to rest for 10 minutes, before I finally snapped and told her to shut up. She stormed out of the room and went to the bedroom. A few moments later I hear beeping from my WiFi speaker, and thought she must have confused it with the one that is in the bedroom. Although she pumped it to max volume and played the chorus to Lily Allen's 'Fuck You'. This just pissed me off even more.\\n\\n\\nShe came out of the room and started talking to me and I told her I didn't want to talk and to leave me alone. She started asking me what was wrong and that it was only just a song, but I really did not want to talk to her at this time. She would not leave me alone, I constantly told her I didn't want to talk, I changed seats and rooms but she wouldn't leave me alone. She just kept asking what's wrong, what did I do. I was ready to leave the apartment just to get some peace, and she only stopped once I put my shoes on and got my keys. She asked me about 100 times what's wrong and I told her each time I don't want to talk and to leave me alone. \\n\\n\\nAs a result I didn't want to go with her to her mother's house for dinner as she just kept pushing and pushing me over the edge. I wanted some time to myself and relax since she wouldn't give it me. Now she's super angry at me for not going saying everything is my fault, her mother is texting me complaining about a $5 pizza she brought me for dinner that no one wants and I just over this day! \\n\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\",\n",

It was the best relationship I ever had; the only real point of contention was that throughout the relationship, he always asked me if I wanted to have sex and I always told him I just didn‚Äôt feel ready. He never ‚Äúpressured‚Äù me, but I could always tell his disappointment. The most we ever did was making out/heavy groping with clothes.\\n\\nWell 6 days ago, we broke up. He told me that he loved me, but he just didn‚Äôt feel sexually satisfied and that he wished me the best, but he thinks it‚Äôs best if we see other people. I was obviously distraught. I felt ugly and unwanted and that nobody would ever love me.\\n\\n3 days after when I was feeling particularly down, a co-worker started hitting on me. I was feeling really low about myself and he talked about how sexy I was and how my boyfriend was an idiot to break up with me. He suggested that maybe we should go to his car. We did and to make a long story short, we ended up at a park having sex. I just felt like I lost everything because of this dumb virginity thing, and he made me feel so wanted and beautiful.\\n\\nWell that night, my ex called me begging for me back. That he‚Äôs okay with waiting and that he loves me. I was so happy but I felt SOO guilty. I tried to bring it up subtly (I said we should get tested) and he was insistent that he didn‚Äôt even kiss another person, but if I really wanted him to, he will. I hinted we should probably get tested together when he said that was a ridiculous idea and he knows I‚Äôm clean.\\n\\nI admitted to him I was feeling really low and actually did end up hooking up with someone. It looked like his heart was being ripped out of his chest. He was solemn for a bit and told me ‚Äúif you just did some heavy petting, I don‚Äôt think you need to get tested‚Äù when I admitted we actually had sex.\\n\\nHe turned **extremely** angry. Let me be clear; I‚Äôve known this man for 2 years. He‚Äôs never even cursed when he hits his foot on the bed, so this was *completely* out of character. He said if ‚Äúall I wanted to do was whore around, then I should‚Äôve told him a long time ago so he wouldn‚Äôt waste his time with me‚Äù and a bunch of other horrible things that makes me sad to repeat :(. He told me we were over and to never speak to him again, and then he blocked me on everything. He also told ALL of our mutual friends that ‚ÄúI wanted to be a hoe and fuck my old, creepy co-worker a day after we broke up and that I‚Äôm a raging bitch‚Äù. My mutual friends all sided with him and nobody wanted to hear that I was just lonely and needed someone, nor would anyone acknowledge that we were broken up at that point and I didn‚Äôt have any obligation to him.\\n\\nMy friends‚Äô reactions‚Äô hurt; I lost many of them and everyone‚Äôs bullying me. I feel horrendous about the entire thing, but I still don‚Äôt see how I was in the wrong. HE broke up with ME, and in my mind, we were done.

I obviously don\\'t mind the 15 year old staying, but I expect her to be out by 18 so we can have our life together. I really do love his daughters, but when they become adults (oldest daughter already is), I don\\'t want to live with them. He isn\\'t responsible for them and neither am I. I can tolerate his mother staying with us, she speaks very little english, so we never fight.\\n\\nHe was listening to me and super respectful. I told him he deserves a break too after so many years.\\n\\nHe said that parenting isn\\'t an 18 year sentence for him. That they are more than daughters, father and grandmother. That they are a family unit. That\\'s how things are in his culture. In his culture, family doesn\\'t stop being family at 18.\\n\\nI brought up that 19 year old is not even paying any bills OR rent right now. He says she doesn\\'t have to, but she does her part by cleaning the whole house (including bedrooms) and taking care of his mother. That there is more than one way to contribute to a household. She\\'s far from a \"leech\". I said that if he wants a live-in caretaker, we\\'ll get one. He was beyond insulted that I compared and reduced his daughter to \"help\". He wants us to live together, but I refuse to do so\\n\\nShe\\'s an adult and she can move out. I\\'m not saying to throw her out now, but maybe give her a few months notice at least. I want her out before her junior year starts for sure. Otherwise, I can\\'t stay with him. He says that he just needs some time to think about it. He told me that financially it doesn\\'t even make sense. Housing is so expensive and everyone saves money this way. She doesn\\'t need to cripple herself with debt when she has a welcoming home. He still felt like I\\'m disrespecting his culture, but he\\'s willing to give it some thought.\\n\\nBefore I left, I went to go speak to the adult daughter. I casually asked when she plans on moving out and she said maybe after her undergraduate degree, **but probably after law school** (There is a great one in this city). But when she becomes a lawyer, she hopes to get a house big enough for myself and her father to have our own large spaces. She\\'ll be saving up and working hard.\\n\\nI asked why? She said that she\\'d want us to stay with her and for her to take care of us in old age. Her exact words were \"fuck a retirement home, I got you guys\".\\n\\nIt sounds bad, but I didn\\'t want to hear that. My life plans do not include her and they don\\'t have to.

It's been a while since I made that post, and my own conclusion is that I am probably both.\\n\\nI've done a LOT of thinking about my behavior that week and I've realized a lot of things. This isn't something that I wrote in my original post because it was off topic and sounded like I was just making excuses for myself, but my dad had passed away earlier that week and I had been in a terrible mood. I wasn't acting like myself at all. Instead of coping in a healthy way, I'd been looking to my girlfriend for a pick-me-up and unfairly blaming her when she failed to deliver (for a reason completely out of her control).\\n\\nThe date wasn't really for her, it was for ME, and that's what I'd been trying to avoid thinking about. I was behaving very selfishly and trying to convince myself that I was just upset because this problem had happened before. The truth was, her period getting in the way of dates had never really bothered me before this time around. I was just looking for reasons to justify my own anger.\\n\\nThat was extremely immature of me, to say the least.\\n\\nI apologized to my girlfriend and, because she's an angel, she accepted the apology. Because of the comments suggesting she may have a medical problem I asked her if she had PCOS or endometris, and surprisingly enough, she said that she had never been examined for either.\\n\\nWe went to have her examined and it turns out that she has PCOS, which essentially means she has cysts in her ovaries, which explains the irregular periods and extreme pain during them. So yeah, I felt horribly guilty about blaming her for that. Luckily she has not seen some of the other symptoms of it (weight gain and hair growth) but she is pretty worried that they will appear. She'll be getting regular treatment from now on so I'm hopeful that she will see some relief soon.\\n\\nTLDR; I was being an ass because of my bad mood and it turns out my girlfriend has PCOS.

       " '\\nNote: I dont want to start a discussion around surrogate mothers, I respect every posture and I think it ends up to the specifics, so please, keep that in mind when commenting.\\n\\nWe‚Äôve been married for 10 years (M40-F32) and have two children. About 5 months ago my sister in law (I‚Äôll call her Donna) and her husband(Jake) started ‚Äújoking‚Äù around with us about the chance of my wife being a surrogate mother for Donna (39) who was recently told by 3 different medics that she cannot have kids on her own. I didn‚Äôt like the tone of the conversation but did not mention anything as it was a ‚Äújoke‚Äù.  3 months passed and the jokes became a direct ask (to my wife only) from Donna and Jake, her mother, Jake‚Äôs Mother  and a ‚Äúclose friend‚Äù. When my wife and me started to discuss this we both agreed it was the best to gather everybody together to decline (we scheduled it for spring-break as all we live a couple of flights away from everybody). \\n\\nFrom time to time we talked about our decision,never changed our minds, but discussed the situation. During one of this talks I mentioned I did not agree due to different factors(my wife agreed on two of them):\\n- Pregnancy is not a game, mother/baby life are literally on risk.\\n- Although Donna and Jake always mentioned they would cover the cost of everything, what would happen if at some point they just turned around and said ‚Äúwe changed our minds‚Äù. (Not to mention we have no idea of the legal implications of the process)\\n- Some background on Donna: she decided not to have kids until now, when my first child was born there was this small talk around her plans for family and she told us that it was not in her plans(not with Jake yet) because she wanted to travel and meet all kind of different places (which she did), when my second child was born she (and Jake now) told us the same and even said they were not sure they wanted to become parents. I‚Äôm not judging her decision, I‚Äôm just mentioning the fact that pregnancy becomes more difficult with age and that is something you need to consider if having family is on your plans.\\n\\nLast week we announced them we would decline their offer and everybody just froze, when we gathered them they thought we would announce we were accepting and this shocked them. Her family started blaming me and my wife about it, saying the common ‚Äúfamily first‚Äù speech. They made us feel like shit and we decided to leave. I‚Äôve been receiving calls every 2-3 days from Donna, Jake and all her family saying that I don‚Äôt have a word on it (even we are married and she is the mother of my kids) that she should be able to decide this on her own. during one of this talks with Donna I mentioned the reasons why I didn‚Äôt wanted to do it and she hung up on me and since then all her family completely shut down communication with us (not complaining on my side), but it affected my wife and the kids also started to ask why they dont get calls from her grandmother. AITA for telling her?\\n\\n\\n[Edited to add info on what I told to Donna.]\\n\\nWhile I was explaining that we had two childs and didnt wanted to take any risk on my wife health she just kept interrupting me with ‚Äúfacts‚Äù about how small that chance was in the present time, and just kept talking about all her research. I got tired of having my(and my wife) actions questioned and told her (not verbatim): ‚ÄúThis is a personal choice, I don‚Äôt like to justify my actions as I don‚Äôt like to ask for other people justifications. You and Jake decided to wait until now to have a family and we respected that can you do the same and respect our decision?‚Äù- that is when she hung up on me.\\n\\n[Edited to add more info on why we told everybody and not only Donna and Jake]\\nThe first call from a third party was from my wife‚Äôs mother. She started the conversation (according to my wife) with ‚Äúwe talked to your sister and she told us they asked you to....‚Äù- nobody else knew at that point so we assume this is true, then Jakes mother and then my wife (and sister in law) friend. At that point this became a regular topic during any call, we thought it would be a good idea to let everybody know at the same time as everybody was involved at that moment (not by our choice) and also because we felt it would make them feel better to have this delivered face to face. Huge mistake, but we never thought they would react the way they did.\\n\\n[Edited, adding clarification]\\nI think there was a confusion, we always talked to them together. The initial approach was with my wife only but they didnt looked surprised when I mentioned it, so I just assumed they were relying the communication through her. My wife was clear on her position , they just assumed I was behind it. (I think they still do)\\n\\n**[FINAL UPDATE ON THE POST]\\nI want to thank you for the support provided on this post, over PMs and for all your different opinions, it really helped us to see things with perspective and provided some comfort to my wife(I shared this post with her). We are sticking to our decision, we‚Äôre not surrogating for them. For those worried for my family(specially my wife) she is doing more than ok, as I mentioned we live far from everybody else(for the last 4 years) and although distance can take a toll on the family in this case is a blessing, we dont need that toxicity around us (specially around our children). No updates so far in the situation, we don‚Äôt have interest in resuming the relation with my SIL and BIL. As for my MIL well... I think my wife has the final word there but it doesnt matter what she decides I‚Äôll be standing next to her side. [I‚Äôll provide an update if anything changes hoping it helps somebody else in the same/similar situation I also think is the least I could do given the support we received, sincerely thank you all!]**',\n",
       " 'I see a lot of posts on here seeking validation for their situation but I honestly don\\'t know if what I did was an asshole move or if my wife is just unreasonably angry at me for this.\\n\\nOne day I saw this valentines day ad for a daddy-daughter dance night and I told my wife that I don\\'t like them. My reasons were this: They are creepy and sexualize the relationship between daughter and father. There are hearts all over the poster. It\\'s on valentines day. The dad and daughter are dressed like they are going to prom together. It\\'s oddly \"date-like\". Not to mention it these dances have their roots purity balls where fathers claim sexual ownership of daughters until marriage. The whole thing just grosses me out and makes my skin crawl. I love my daughter with all my heart, but I don\\'t want to date her. I also don\\'t want to reinforce weird gender and patriarchal stereotypes in my daughters young mind.\\n\\nMy daughter is 2. This shit is all hypothetical for the future. I was just expressing my distaste for them to my wife upon seeing this poster. She lost it. She was shaking and crying. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen her look at me with such disdain.  She thinks I would be denying my daughter a special bonding experience. She was worried my daughter would feel so hurt and left out by this. I don\\'t think I\\'d ever not go if it\\'s something that my daughter really really wanted, but I still think as parents it\\'s our duty to do better than \"it\\'s tradition\". I\\'ve never been one to buy into that crap. People do a lot of horrible nonsense because they\\'re told it\\'s what they\\'re supposed to do.\\n\\nI don\\'t see the big deal in not wanting to participate in a weird archaic past-time that sexualizes my relationship with my daughter. I can kind of see my wife\\'s point, but she was so mad I literally didn\\'t understand it. Help me out, AITA?\\n\\nEDIT 1:\\n\\nI should have mentioned that my wife\\'s father isn\\'t really involved in her life and hasn\\'t been since she was 3. She sees him a little every few years, but he didn\\'t show up at our wedding or meet our daughter despite invitations to both. No doubt this has something to do with her sensitivity about this issue.\\n\\nEDIT 2:\\n\\n1. A decent amount of people think I\\'m gross for saying the dances were sexualized and maybe that was a bit too far. I meant that they are treated in a romantic fashion, not necessarily sexual. The way they treat it like a romantic prom date on or near valentines day where you slow dance with your daughter to love songs just makes me feel like a male version Lucille Bluth. \\\\*Shudder\\\\*\\n2. As a couple people pointed out purity balls actually came about in 1998. Daddy/daughter dances were happening before that. I think these dances REMIND me of purity balls in a lot of ways, but I was wrong to say they were rooted in them. Also, some people are saying mommy/son dances are a thing but I\\'ve never seen nor heard of any personally. I see daddy/daughter dances all the time though.\\n3. There are also people saying \"do something else with your daughter instead\". I do. Here\\'s a little background. As of right now my wife works the better job. She makes more money and has insanely good health benefits and we don\\'t wanna pay for daycare so I work a couple online jobs and stay home to take care of my kiddo. These dances are from a time when a dad went to work and the mom stayed home and raised the kids. Dads were distant and didn\\'t raise their kids. So these dances were a way for a dad to actually spend time with their daughters. I promise you that\\'s not the case here. I spend every single day with my daughter. We do fun stuff all the time. No worries there.\\n4. I feel like a lot of people here think I believe these things are bad because I think dancing with my daughter is sexual. That\\'s not true. I dance with her now. I\\'m affectionate. I hug and kiss her. I nap and cuddle with her. It\\'s my favorite thing in the world. However, context is important. Like yeah, it\\'s innocent to breast feed, but if you saw a 10 year old boy doing it, you\\'d be a little weirded out. These dances are something that weirds me out. I can\\'t help it. It\\'s a visceral reaction to it. I do think people are missing the part where I said I would absolutely go if my daughter really wanted to. I would be uncomfortable about it probably, but I\\'d never hurt my daughter if it meant that much to her.\\n5. Just had to laugh at the marriage counseling suggestion. Just needed a \"delete facebook and hit the gym\" and the reddit relationship advice would be complete. We\\'re fine. We\\'ve had plenty of talks about her shitty dad. I\\'m nothing like him, thankfully. I honestly think her reaction could\\'ve been stress related and I just hit a nerve at the wrong time, but I don\\'t see the point in bringing it up again. Sometimes in marriage and parenting you won\\'t agree on things and that\\'s okay. You compromise or work around it... or in this case never speak of it again unless you have to.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUPDATE: Apparently (in this situation) I\\'m not the asshole! But honestly thank you to everyone for your thoughts, ideas and criticisms. It helped to know some people that went to these things had neutral or positive experiences. It also helped me to know other people are just as creeped out about these dances as I am. Now I don\\'t feel so crazy. Whatever your opinion on it, just know I\\'m gonna keep doing the best I can to be a good dad, dances or not. Thanks for your help reddit!',\n",

I do accept them as they are, but I just can\\'t help feeling sad.

He said we can get a dog, but it\\'s not the same and I feel like he is the asshole for even comparing grandchildren to pets. I think that even though my sons are upset with me now, they should understand what this means to me since I\\'m too old to have more children.\\n\\nWhich one of us is in the wrong here?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Edit: Thank you all for your replies, but seeing as how many nasty comments and PMs I\\'m getting, I\\'ll be logging off and not responding to anyone anymore. I don\\'t need to be told I\\'m a vile cunt, a bitch, the worst mother ever, and a disgusting, toxic person that should never be around children. I\\'ll take the kind advice to heart and try to fix the damage I\\'ve done with my sons, and the rest of you should evaluate what sort of person you are if you can\\'t resist the urge to send strangers messages about how they\\'re a \"homophobic hag\" and you hope their sons will never talk to them again.**',\n",
       " 'I‚Äôm a woodworker on the side, I made my best friend a wooden American flag because he said he would love one. Only charged him cost of materials and shipping cost around $20. He then asked me to make another flag for a gift for his mom. I still gave it to him for cheap because growing up I was close with his family, but now he asked me to make the same flags for 5 other people in his family and one coworker. Keep in mind I sell these size flags for $150 and he assumed this time it would still be $20 each flag. I promptly told him I can‚Äôt do that cost anymore, it was only really a deal for him because he is my best friend and I agreed to it the second time bc it was for his mom but now these are for people I don‚Äôt even no. Told him I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs not gonna happen. He responded ‚Äúoh, ok...‚Äù and it‚Äôs been weird ever since, really short. Should I have just done it and not risk ruining our friendship?\\n\\nUpdate: followed some advice on here and let him know I‚Äôm not upset but broke down what all goes into it. Said there aren‚Äôt any hard feelings but just wanted him to know why I said what I said. I‚Äôll update with his response.\\n\\nUpdate #2: He did give an apology of sorts. Said he thought that getting my flags out to different people would help more people see my products which could lead to more revenue. I told him I appreciate that but I currently stay busy enough without it and that I wouldn‚Äôt mind giving him 50% off only bc we‚Äôre boys but this would be the last time. He said he didn‚Äôt mean for it to come across the way it did. Idk I still feel like it isn‚Äôt resolved, we‚Äôre going out for beers this weekend. Going to get him to understand my side of things.\\n\\nFinal update: He sent me a random message last night profusely apologizing. Apparently he was talking to his wife and she tore into him and was upset he would do that haha he just sent a PayPal payment for 5 flags at full price. Glad it all worked out, I‚Äôm going to make him something customized as a thank you for the business. Thank you all for the advice. ‚úåüèª',\n",

Trying my best to make this coherent. \\n\\nI have had this friend named ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù since I was in elementary school (we are all 23 and 25 now). I literally have swooned for him since I was a little kid. I love him so much I can‚Äôt even put it into words. We dated in high school but I stupidly broke it off with him when I went to college because I wanted ‚Äúexperience.‚Äù We‚Äôd always, always hook up when we saw each other but he we always parted ways but amicably. My friends always joked that I never poured myself fully into other guys because Alex was ‚Äúin reserve.‚Äù There‚Äôs probably some real truth to this. \\n\\nSo enter Jeremy. He‚Äôs a very good guy I met on tinder who I liked a lot who had potential. I saw him maybe 3 times a week since January and I guess we were exclusive but we never discussed it. \\n\\n\\nLast week I saw Alex‚Äôs mom and she told me that Alex was moving home because he‚Äôd been assigned (he‚Äôs air Force) to fly the planes that do training in the city closest to us. I about died of excitement. I texted him right away and he won‚Äôt be moving until August but he asked if I‚Äôd be willing to drive to San Diego and spend the weekend with him. Before i even set my phone down I was packing a bag and on rhe higway. I just had the most amazing weekend of my life and as I was leaving Alex told me that if I‚Äôm not careful he‚Äôs going to marry me and give me babies with his dimples. I was literally on cloud 9 the entire drive back because it‚Äôs all I ever wanted. We made plans for me to come visit him and maybe drive cross country with him when he moves. \\n\\nWell i completely forgot about Jeremy and I feel terrible about it. When I got home he was sitting in my parking spot both scared because I‚Äôd disappeared and mad that I‚Äôd stood him up on Saturday. I invited him in to give him the news in person and he freaked the fuck out. He went through every emotion possible from crying and begging me to reconsider to literally calling me an asshole for breaking his heart. He kept saying things like I‚Äôm shallow for chosing  ‚Äútop gun over the guy who pours concrete‚Äù I tried to explain the history but he said he just wasn‚Äôt buying it. \\n\\n**edit: just to be clear this is how I came to see \"Alex\" this past weekend:**\\n\\n**I live outside Tucson, AZ. Alex is finishing up pilot training in Texas. I saw his mom at a grocery store here in Tucson last week. She\\'s always loved me so she said that Alex had just (like that day) gotten news that he would be assigned back in Tucson for his jet training and he was going to call me. I couldn\\'t wait so I texted him. He asked what I was doing this weekend. I said nothing (wrongly as I already had plans). He said that there was a training mission to San Diego and he could hop on it and wanted to know if I could drive there (it\\'s about 6 hours). I said yes...that\\'s how we came to see each other.**\\n\\nI feel really bad for what I‚Äôve done but am I an asshole?\\n\\n\\nEdit: everyone wins, I\\'m a terrible, terrible person and I should be cast away from polite society and Jeremy should get a medal for trying so hard to be nice to me and Alex deserves to stick his dick In non-crazy pussy.',\n",

Everything has honestly been great so far and it looked to be a great vacation, until recently. This is where my 13 year old son James comes in. James has been a problem child as of recent. He\\'s been acting up in school, getting in trouble around the house, and been an overall headache for me. I\\'ve always had the mindset that \"kids will be kids\". Hating school is fine, I get it. And he\\'s getting to that age where he\\'s going to push back a little but he has tested my every nerve.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve tried to handle it with care and be \"the good cop\". Try and handle it with love and care, you know? Well, that changed this last week. James was caught shoplifting. The store called us and my wife had to go and deal with it. The owner was nice enough not to get the police involved and we made James pay for what he was going to steal.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThat was not enough for me. The minute I got home I sat him down and lectured him. He seemed to not really care and eventually started to argue with me. Eventually I had enough and told him that he\\'s lost his right to go to Disney with us. He immediately started to apologize and begged to go but I told him no. I told him he will instead be going to my parents and working on my dads farm for that time while his sisters have fun at Disney.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nJames has been a wreak since then. He\\'s been crying to his mom for me to reconsider and claiming he\\'ll stop being bad but I don\\'t buy it. My wife says i\\'m being to harsh and to let him go but I feel like this is where we need to put our foot down. My dad says I\\'m doing the right thing and is all for working him while we go to Disney but could I be wrong. I feel like maybe a second opinion would be good here. So, what do you guys think?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit:  \\nI want to thank you all. Getting a second opinion has helped me see the situation from other perspectives and I feel a lot better about this now. I talked with my wife for over an hour during my lunch break and we\\'ve decided we\\'ll give James a second chance. We are going to talk more tonight but I\\'m going to frank here, it\\'s going to be very tough for him to regain my trust and go on the trip. Me and my wife talked about the possibility of him moving in with my parents the moment he\\'s out of school and working on the farm until we leave. If he act\\'s up there then the trips off and he\\'s on the farm for till we get back. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs some of you have mentioned though I may want to get to the root of this too. I\\'m going to sit James down tonight as well and talk with him and see if I can figure out what\\'s going on with him. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThank you all for the help',\n",

       " 'Some backstory; so a few months ago I agreed to watch my sisters kids while she was at work because she‚Äôs a single mom. She has 3 kids, 2 boys and 1 girl. One of the boys has autism and it was fine in the beginning until he started acting up a lot.\\nIt started with him stomping in my apartment (I live in an upstairs unit with really nice old people below me and I didn‚Äôt want to give them too much trouble) I asked him to stop so he dropped to the floor and kicked and screamed. A couple days later he squeezed an entire tube of toothpaste on my carpet and when I told him to clean it, he threw another tantrum. It was so bad that my neighbors came to check on me, he had been so rude he had me in tears because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, luckily my neighbor used to be a special ed teacher and was able to calm him down and get him to clean the mess up, but I don‚Äôt want her to have to do that all the time. Last night was the last straw, he hit my cat, then when I confronted him, he head butted me and gave me a bloody nose. I can do this anymore he‚Äôs been nothing but disrespectful in my home and I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore, however his siblings did nothing wrong at any point and have been very helpful and sweet (the kids are 13, 11, and 3.

You can also check the responses I already received in another post over at [r/relationship\\\\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice). Breach yourselves for a lengthy read if you do so however.\\n\\nI (32M) have been married to my wife (29F) for 7 years now. I met my wife during college and now she is a stay-at-home mom to our two kids. Our two daughters are 7 and 5 years old.\\n\\nI work as a marine engineer on rigs and ships for a large part of the year. This leads to me spending a lot of time away from home. The time I'm away from my family isn't very easy on me either, but maritime technology is my passion. I love life at sea.\\n\\nThese are not the ideal circumstances to raise a family in, I realize, but my career choices have always been consensual between husband and wife. For years all was well and good because we found a balance.\\n\\nHowever, a new lucrative contract entails me working on board for 3 month stretches, only being able to briefly return home by plane when shore-side at certain ports. My vacation time inbetween is 45 days. It's been like this for almost a year now. When I told her about this offer she was not very elated, rather disappointed even, but she acquiesced seeing my excitement and when I laid out the numbers. Also, this isn't a permanent arrangement either.\\n\\nFast forward to last week. I return home after an assignment, eager to jump into vacation with my family. Instead of a heartwarming welcome, I get sat down by my wife in the kitchen. She took my kids to her parents' house, so they weren't around. She starts telling me that she has had a long time to think about this, 'literally', seeing as I'm away from home so often and for so long, tells me I never listen to her concerns and she proceeds to issue me an ultimatum. Either I seriously think about changing careers or she moves back to her parents' house (with my kids) and she files for divorce and custody. My eyes almost popped out of my head.\\n\\nTalking to her about it later, she still wouldn't budge. I proposed getting more help around the house if she needed that (a nanny), but she would have none of it. The only thing that could appease her is hearing out of my mouth that I would quit my current position or that I would go into therapy with her. So I ended up agreeing with the latter, because I cannot just promise the former. But I have little hope for this interim solution.\\n\\nWhy is there no mutual compromise possible? I work my ass off every day I'm out at sea, to provide for this family. I absolutely LOVE what I do, and I would have a hard time letting it go. But neither do I want to lose my children, which I'm sure I would, with the exception of visitation rights.\\n\\nAITA for seriously doubting my marriage here, and possibly hurting my kids in the process? WIBTA if I chose my career over my family.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: My expectations were not betrayed in regard to the response. I recognize everyone's concern for my family and believe me (or don't, as is your right), I have their best interests at heart, even if it seems like I don't considering my absence. I have tried a lot in these last few years, to make things easier on them: I set them up with all the necessary equipment to have some quality Facetime, Skype, ... moments ; I bring little souvenirs from every port city we ever moored, to give them little reminders; I always pick out a nice gift to return home with for my wife; I pray to God every night that the shitty offshore internet would not give out before I got to make my call for the day; I have long chats with my wife, where we (used to) laugh together, talk about our day, where she could tell me anything, share her frustrations (and yes, sometimes she would voice her loneliness, her workload, her envy at other couples. As would I, but we always came to a mutual understanding, knowing that this would not be permanent, would only be until I safely secured my position with my employer - I guess I did indeed push my luck and now have to face the fallout), I try to play games with the kids over video chat which they always seem to enjoy and have them tell me about their day, their friends, about scouting and soccer games. It saddens me that I don't get to attend all their games and events, but when I can I'm their fiercest supporter on the sidelines. But that's the only thing I'll ever be, won't I? A dad on the sidelines...\\n\\nI know I am largely at fault here. And sadly, I cannot deny that I do carry around some resentment towards my wife, because of the events of the last weeks, and that I should work on this, seeing as she has every right to call our current game plan into question if it doesn't work for her anymore. But I NEED room to transition.\\n\\nThis work schedule is very recent (I'm not even a full year in) and the previous arrangement was much more in favor of family life, with more frequent and longer home visits. Also much less paid of course. I am already in the process of negotiating with my employer, looking at prospects of reappointment. Seeing as my work on the drillship is not compatible with my wife's plans, they might agree with relocating me to another offshore platform, closer to home, maybe in the Gulf of Mexico, lending itself to more time at home. It happens that contracts can be revised in face of family troubles and there are provisions that take this into account, but it'll always come down to time. And I'm not sure how much more time she is willing to give me. If I come to an agreement, I will bring this to the table as my 'compromise'. If she still refuses, then I can propose a stationary position at the port of Miami, which would entail me moving there. This isn't a given either, knowing that she would like to stay close to her family, them being local to the area we live in, as a few commenters aptly pointed out.\\n\\nI have written down all my thought these last few hours. I've got a clear strategy. I'll use this as a backdrop the coming days and weeks. The final say will be hers. If she still wants a divorce, she'll get one, and I won't make it hard on her. I do recognize the sacrifices she has made these last years, after all.\",\n",

While I am working to get my education back on track I wanted to maintain a steady amount of hours at my part time job and maybe save a little bit of money.

I tell them that they are always welcome to bring their own dishes if they want, but typically they just bring along beer.\\n\\nIn the past couple years though, my friends have started getting married, engaged, and pregnant. My house has become the default hosting venue for all these events. It started with my hosting my best friends engagement party and subsequent wedding related events, but then our larger group also expected me to host. I don't mind offering my place up, but somehow they all also thought that meant I would be catering the parties as well. I did all of this for my best friend, but we did get into an argument about the food. I told her that I did not want to splurge on catering since I can prepare everything myself, but that I would still be creating a fully vegan menu since I don't cook non-vegan foods. I told her that if she and her partner wanted meat, they could pay for it and I would display it. She said that I was being selfish and controlling. We went through a rough patch but we are ok now. This has spread throughout our friend group though and now they complain about the food almost every time I invite people over.\\n\\nI stopped hosting a few months back, and yes, again, I hear nothing but complaints. I'm pretty frustrated and don't know what to do. I don't want to host anything anymore, period. But this means that I haven't really seen my friends much in the past few months. Was I being an asshole?\",\n",
       " 'Some background is in order and I\\'m using a throwaway. I have history with my BIL that predates him dating and marrying my sister. In college he dated a good friend of mine and I was certain (still am) he was cheating on her so I told her and she dumped him. He lies about it to this day but needless to say we don\\'t get along. When he started dating my sister I tried to warn her about him but she was so \"in love\" she refused to heed my warnings. They\\'ve been married for 18 years and I\\'m certain there\\'s infidelity and abuse but I have no proof and my sister cuts me off when I bring it up. \\n\\nSo to the crux of the issue. Two weeks ago I picked my nephew (11) up from baseball. I asked him how things were going and asked him if he had any issues he\\'d like to talk to me about. He said no so I asked if he\\'d been offered drugs. He sort of perked up and said no but that his dad said \"I don\\'t care if you do cocaine or smoke pot.\" \\n\\nI was livid so I stormed into their house and tried to discuss with my BIL. He said he was too busy to talk and asked if I was freaking out about \"nonsense\" again. I told him this was about what he said to my nephew. He said to stay out of he and his kids business and he wasn\\'t even comfortable with me driving the kid and would talk to my sister about it. I stormed out and thought about what I should do. \\n\\nSo the next morning I went directly to the kids principal and told her what I\\'d heard. She profusely thanked me and said she would address the issue. I was very happy that at least some sort off authority figure knew. \\n\\nLater in the day I got a text from niece saying \"Aunt Shana, what did you tell the principal?\" I told her that was adult stuff. She texted back \"My dad never said we should do drugs!\" I told her \"honey, let the adults handle this ok.\" Her response was \"he told us that he doesn\\'t care if we do drugs like smoke pot but he wants us to realize that if we do drugs, we have to get them from drug dealers who can be really awful people! Please take this back!\" I told her again that if that\\'s what he said it\\'s just as bad and she needed to let the adults handle this. I got a text from my sister later that night saying \"please leave my kids out of whatever your issue is today.\" I told her \"I\\'m always here to talk about what is truly going on in your house.\" \\n\\nWell fast forward to late last week and I guess my sister and BIL got a visit from our state\\'s version of CPS. CPS called me, I told them the truth that I feel my BIL is abusive and an adulterer and the thing about the drugs. My sister called me later that day apoplectic at what I\\'d done, so did my parents and other siblings. Everyone is furious with me. I told my sister that I was always here for her if she ever wanted to talk about the abuse I know she receives from my BIL and she told me that she never wants to speak to my \"fat, ugly ass ever again\" and hung up.\\n\\nI am basically ostracized from my niece and nephew so I want an honest opinion, was I the asshole here?',\n",

       " 'I met my best friend in high school. She had this boyfriend who was bad for her and she never saw it. They were on and off for a few years. After we graduated, she moved in with him. She ended up getting pregnant and then moving to a different state. That didn‚Äôt work out, so they moved back here. I was still there for here, and was still her best friend through all of this. One day, we were hanging out, having a good time. We went to the mall, I bought us BOTH some lunch, and then we went back home. I told her I would be right back as I needed to use the bathroom. While I was in the bathroom, she stole my card out of my purse without me knowing. I came back, and she said she had to go. So I have her a hug, we said I love you, and she left. Later that night, I went to the store to buy some groceries. I went to pay, and my card was no where to be found. I thought I must have left it at home. I checked my account as soon as I got home and $300 was missing. There were charges from Victoria secret, target, and some other places I can‚Äôt remember. I was in shock, and so upset. I texted her, freaking out, and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I‚Äôm crying for you! Maybe you left it at the mall?‚Äù Which I knew I didn‚Äôt, because I bought lunch after we went there and I know I didn‚Äôt leave it.

We had several \"casual meetings\" and by our third \"date\", he shared just enough of his life for me to realize who he was. In fact, he started telling me about Mommy and apparently, he hates Mommy more than Mommy hates me. So, I felt encouraged to tell him I know her and we spent hours talking about all the ways she\\'s treated us like garbage. The worst thing she did was kick him out when he was 17 for being gay and then beg him to come back and pretend she loves him (while making his life hell) because his grandmother threatened to cut her out of the will.\\n\\nThe thing is, Sonny and I kind of get along, but we\\'re not really each other\\'s type. We both agreed on that. Like, the sex is good, but the rest is meh, we have nothing in common. However, Sonny had this idea to pretend we\\'re an actual couple just to spite her, and I like it. Sonny\\'s birthday is coming up and he is having a barbecue with his friends and family. So he wants me to come so that we can giggle and hold hands and kiss in front of Mommy.\\n\\nI told my girlfriends about it like \"ha ha, listen to this funny story\" and they were all appalled. They said I was an asshole, a pervert, petty (I agree that I am petty) and that I have \"no moral compass\".

She said she misunderstood and thought I was using him, and her interpretation was confirmed by the other two girls freaking out and not letting me finish.

But some were absurd like the fact that no one is supposed to take pictures except the photographer for the whole event, no facial hair will be allowed or you will not be pictured, or that any women with shoulder length or longer hair must have it cut or wear it in a pony tail. The worst though were the \"gift requirements\". According to the email a gift of 300$ value or more MUST be given (or $250 cash) or you will not be allowed into the venue. The email also ends with \"Those who choose not to follow these rules will be asked to leave. Please think of the bride and groom\\'s wishes during this stressful time\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is a joke, right? Like I can understand micromanaging but that\\'s just absurd.

He has a crisp hundred dollar bill and a few photos and debit cards, ID etc.\\n\\nMy first reaction is to keep his money and continue on with my day, but after seeing the photos of his very young kids I could tell he was a new dad and prob needed that money. I recently had a child of my own and I know that feels man. So being a good person, I drove to his house ( address on ID ) which was around the corner and I pull up our front and park.\\n\\nNow...lets call our missing wallet dude \"john\" for obvious reasons.. I approach the house on foot, very large and duplex style.I went straight to \"unit A\" as the ID stated and knocked. A 20 year old looking guy (possible brother) opens and I ask for \"John\". The dude immediately responds with, \"He doesn\\'t live here, never has\". Just basically dismissing \"john\" completely. I look behind this dude and I can SEE PHOTOS of the \"john\" hanging on walls and what not. I attempt to explain the situation and the dude slams the door on my face. I\\'m a little annoyed now. I knock one more time to try to explain and nothing. Fuck it..I turn and walk back to my car. .As I\\'m walking away...I hear someone behind me yelling..\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nLow and behold...It\\'s my guy John! He\\'s cursing up a storm. Telling me that If I ever come back He\\'ll kill me and to not fuck with him or his family. I couldn\\'t believe it. I hadn\\'t even told them what I was there for and I\\'m being threatened. At this point I realized this was a complete waste of time and went straight to my car. Drove off and threw his wallet at his front sidewalk. I\\'m now A hundred dollars richer. AITA for keeping his cash',\n",

I picked up my Uber passengers tonight, who were international Chinese students, which is not unusual, it's a relatively large college town.\\n\\nI did my usual Uber driver routine: Ask a question or two to gauge willingness for conversation; if I get one word answers, and/or no followup reciprocating questions, I leave it alone. They gave off a major no interest in talking vibe, so I left it alone.\\n\\nCut to 3 minutes later, and they start talking about something which, for the sake of their privacy, I feel legitimately uncomfortable even sharing anonymously here. It was really fucked up heavy personal shit. I am not a fluent speaker, but good enough to follow 80% of a conversation, and I was getting very uncomfortable.\\n\\nI guess the reason I ask is because I am 100% sure that if they had any idea I could understand them, they wouldn't have been talking about what they were talking about. It felt like I almost lying by omission? I could have interjected super briefly, in Chinese, to let them know I understood, but it felt like that would have been more awkward than just letting them believe I didn't understand.\",\n",
       " \"**UPDATE [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/user/confusedbfthrowaway1/comments/bgi725/update_aita_for_not_being_able_to_accept_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) BC I'M APPARENTLY NOT ALLOWED TO POST THEM HERE**\\n\\nI know how the title of this sounds but please hear me out. Also, this is a throwaway bc I'm pretty sure my partner knows my main account and I don't want her to see this. \\n\\nAbout a year ago my (20M) partner (25F) came out to me as polyamorous, and told me that she'd like to begin having sexual relationships with other men. She told me that, for her, it's not a case of wanting to date other people but more to make our relationship an open one where she's free to sleep with others if she wants too. I'm by no means an old fashioned dude - hell I even suggested we try out three ways for this, which she said wasn't the same - but I'm pretty into monogamy and told her that I wasn't necessarily comfortable with the idea of her sleeping with other guys. Note: I'm not judging anyone who *is* into this type of relationship, just that it isn't at all for me.\\n\\nLong story short, she got absolutely hysterical about the fact that I told her I was uncomfortable with it, told me how depressed she was not being able to explore her sexuality to the fullest and pointing out how supportive she was of me when I came out as bisexual. I eventually caved and told her okay, but on the conditions that a) she doesn't bring anyone else into our bed and b) I don't have to hear about it in detail. She agreed and got on with finding other guys pretty quickly. She became noticeably happier after she started this, so I've just been kinda grinning and bearing it. \\n\\nThing is, she's seemingly become completely disinterested in having a physical relationship with me since she started them with other dudes. I'm not someone who's asking for sex every single night, but at this point I'm lucky if we do it once a month and she never wants to be casually affectionate with me any more. It's gotten to the point where our five year old daughter has noticed, and has asked me why mummy doesn't kiss me goodbye when she goes out any more. It feels like we're just mates who share a bed. Conversely, she's going to meet other guys at least once a week and I'm fairly sure she's sleeping with them at least half the time. \\n\\nI brought my concerns up to her and she got upset again, saying I had no right to be mad bc she was sticking to my terms and that I was trying to police her sexuality. I'm now in a place where I'm completely torn. As I said, she's noticeably happier when she's exploring her sexuality to the fullest and of course I want her to be happy. And she really was very supportive of me when I came out as bi. But it's really killing me that she seems to not want anything to do with me intimately any more. I get that these guys are probably older and more experienced than I am, but it bums me out that I'm not enough for her. \\n\\nSo what do y'all think? Am I being an arsehole and should I just get over myself and try to learn to accept her more? Or am I justified in being upset?\\n\\nETA: made a comment saying this but people are still asking so I'll post an explanation about how I'm 20 with a 5 year old daughter. When I was a teen I was in a very violent and toxic environment at home. A dude in our building who I would petsit for took pity on me when things got real bad at home and would let me crash on his couch if I needed to get out of my parents' place for a night or two. My now gf was his flatmate and made it apparent she was interested in me, thinking I was ~17 (age of consent in the UK is 16). I didn't turn down her advances because I was a dumb 15 year old who thought banging a hot 20 year old chick would be peak cool. Clearly in retrospect this wasn't a good idea, and no she didn't back off when she realised she was wrong about my age (obviously), but that's how that went down for everyone who's curious.\",\n",

I had a great evening and I came home at about 11pm. \\n\\nWhen I got home I was really tired. I hadn‚Äôt slept the night before since I had to study for a really big test.

One day there's a heated argument I'm not sure how it started but one of my black students called a white student a nigger. I told him that was enough and we don't use that sort of racist language at school (or anywhere i hope). He gets sent to the principal's office and he gets a detention. A lot of students then started yelling at me saying that i shouldn't punish him for that because he's black.

Renting a car was too expensive, and the city bus wasn‚Äôt an option, so I got the school‚Äôs permission to take an Uber there and back with them. \\n\\nA standard Uber is supposed to be able to carry 4 passengers. I had 3 students with me and we ordered our Uber. It arrived and one of my students said to me ‚ÄúWait that can‚Äôt be our car. There‚Äôs a kid in the front seat!‚Äù Sure enough, it was our Uber. And she had (presumably) her child in the front seat. Meaning there were only 3 available seats in the car. She rolled down her window and I said ‚ÄúOh....there‚Äôs 4 of us...‚Äù and she rolled her eyes at me and said ‚ÄúWell the app doesn‚Äôt tell you that!‚Äù Uhhhh...You‚Äôre supposed to be able to carry 4 passengers??? \\n\\nI looked at my kids and they go ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay!

I didn‚Äôt want to cancel the ride since the driver was already there, and we were short on time. So I ended up having to send one of my kids back to class. But I was kind of miffed that the driver had her kid in the car taking up one of the seats she was supposed to have available. I thought Uber drivers weren‚Äôt allowed to have kids in the car for insurance reasons?

I know sometimes people with kids need to make a living and can‚Äôt find a sitter. And it could have been a one time thing. But also I feel like it‚Äôs not cool to have a kid in the car if you drive for Uber. Not only if 4 people need to ride with you and you don‚Äôt have the space. But for safety and insurance reasons as well. If there was an accident, would the child be covered under the driver‚Äôs insurance?? I don‚Äôt want to snitch on someone just trying to make a living, but I also kind of feel like Uber should maybe know.

       " 'Last night, I (20M) ended an almost two year long relationship with my girlfriend (19F), let‚Äôs say Kelsey, after she gave me an ultimatum that I need to attend church every Sunday or she would break up with me. \\n\\nBackground: Kelsey knows my history with being forced to go to a Southern Baptist Church from the time I was born until I left for college, which is ironically about the same time we‚Äôve started dating. Being forced to go to church services with messages I did not agree with pushed me away from religion instead of helping me develop a healthy relationship with God. \\n\\nLast year, during my first year of college, I only went to church a couple times throughout the year, mostly when Kelsey asked me too. Going to a Methodist church and hearing a different message of the gospel being preached was refreshing and I didn‚Äôt mind going whenever she asked. I had begun to grow a healthy relationship with the church and God again. \\n\\nDuring the first semester of this school year (Fall 2018), we went to church a few times again but nothing too seriously. She is a freshman and college and it took some time for her to adjust and figure out what she wants and needs. After winter break, she decided she wants to go to church more often and I support her 100%, as I believe in helping her grow as she needs to, and I‚Äôd even been attended church more too as I have been feeling much better about it again. \\n\\nThe problem happened two weeks ago when Kelsey hit me with this ultimatum: either I start attended church every Sunday, or we break up. I took some time to think about it and realized that‚Äôs not where I‚Äôm at in my faith and if I start feeling forced to go to church again, it will ruin the relationship I have built back up with it. I tried to explain this and she countered that I truly just don‚Äôt want to grow and that I need to force myself to do it. I told her I could build up to going every Sunday but I can‚Äôt just flip a switch right now, and she said it‚Äôs something she needs long-term. I asked Kelsey to please stay with me and continue to support me by helping me build my faith as I have been doing so that this long-term relationship can happen, because I do love her and she truly makes me happy. She said she can‚Äôt do that and I have to fully commit myself how to going to church every Sunday because that‚Äôs what she needs in a boyfriend.  I told her I just can‚Äôt do that for her right now as it would feel as if I‚Äôm controlled and forced to go, despite my feelings on it. She wouldn‚Äôt budge even after I tried so hard to find ways to make it work. \\n\\nEventually, I realized I was just beating a dead horse, and said that if there‚Äôs nothing we can agree on other than her way, I can‚Äôt do that right now. I feel that faith is a very personal journey and at 20 years old, that journey needs to be decided my right now. \\n\\nSo Reddit, AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend over a sudden religious ultimatum thrown at me?',\n",
       " \"Alright here goes. For reference, I am a 24y.o. straight male, my sister is 26. Lets start with some background.\\n\\nFor the past 5 years or so, I have started growing my hair out. In my biased opinion, I have amazing thick, curly hair. In public, I often receive random compliments on my hair. People who know me know how much I love my long hair. If given a chance, I will usually talk about it. Everyone has their favorite thing about their appearance, and my curls are my favorite.\\n\\nNow, a few years back, I made the decision to donate my curls. So I chopped 9 inches off, and began to grow out my hair again. After about 2 years, I made a second donation. I rather enjoy doing this. I get to help people, and indulge my ego at the same time. Win-win. \\n\\nMy family is somewhat conservative (politically, but mostly just about life), and as such, my parents have never liked my hair long, as it looks 'unprofessional'. But I am an adult, so they just make side comments about how I need a haircut. Nothing to hurt our relationship over. My sister is the only family member who outright supports my hair choices. Since I didnt grow up with long hair, she is usually where I go for advice on issues with the curly struggle (and r/curlyhair of course).\\n\\nNow, for the dilemma. My sister is getting married in a few months. She has asked me to cut my hair before the wedding so that it looks more 'appropriate'. I get along great with her fiance, but he has a more conservative view on life, like my parents, so she has developed that a bit more herself. I assume that it part of the thinking behind her request. As of now, it has been ~9 months since my last haircut, and it usually takes about 2ish years to get the length needed for donation. If the wedding fell around that 2 year mark, I would have no problem making the cut and donation and satisfying her for the wedding photos.\\n\\n*BUT...* thats not the case. I have tried telling my sister no light heartedly, but she seems firm that since its her wedding, its her call on whether or not I cut my hair. It even came up once with my mom on a phone call, and my mother is 100% for the haircut. I dont really want to because I have finally hit a length I can actually do stuff with, and I dont want to lose the 9mo of growth Ive gotten since my last cut. \\n\\nYes, I am in the wedding party as a groomsmen, and I think this is the biggest issue for my sister. All of her wedding photos with me will have my long hair, and she would prefer it to be short for her eternal memories. \\n\\nTLDR: AITA for not cutting my hair for my sisters wedding when my entire family supports the cut?\\n\\nEdit: Just fyi, my sister is not (yet) close to what I would call a Bridezilla. This whole debate has been cordial, and we get along pretty well as a family. Im just looking for an outside opinion on the situation, not insults to my sister.

I had known she hadn\\'t been well. She says she\\'s getting worse and is thinking about going to the hospital, and asks me if I can hold onto our daughter to allow her to do so. I say alright. I tell my girlfriend sorry, I can\\'t collect you guys later, I still have my kid (who was sleeping in my bed for 7). My gf totally lost it and has now blocked me. She considers this me putting my ex before her, rather than me handling my responsibilities as a father and the other person responsible for creating this child. Ofcourse if one parent is unwell the very first option is the other parent. Right? My girlfriend says my ex should have got one of her friends or family to watch my kid to allow her to go to the hospital, as it was officially \"her time with her\" and not my responsibility. She says my response should have been \"not my problem, I\\'m only responsible for her til 7\". I completely disagree with this.

I‚Äôd rather have a small celebration with close family and friends and keep some of the money for our future as I‚Äôd like to have children some day and possibly travel a bit before that. \\nMy partner has no savings so isn‚Äôt in a position contribute anything. \\nI‚Äôm not prepared to ask my parents to pay for something I‚Äôm not prepared to pay for myself, and I haven‚Äôt explicitly asked but I don‚Äôt think my partners parents are in a position to pay for the wedding either.\\n\\nI‚Äôve been standing fairly firm in my belief that it‚Äôs unreasonable to be expected to empty my savings for something my fianc√© isn‚Äôt able to contribute to at all. However this has been going on so long now I‚Äôm starting to doubt myself and worry I‚Äôm maybe not appreciating how important a big fancy wedding is to some people. So I‚Äôm doing what every reasonable person does in this situation and turning to reddit for opinions!\\n\\nEDIT: I didn‚Äôt state this initially as I didn‚Äôt feel it would or should influence people‚Äôs opinions. But we‚Äôre a same-sex couple so my fianc√© is a he not a she!\\n\\nEDIT 2: No I am not Chandler Bing!! I‚Äôm a huge friends fan and was expecting a few comments about this. Funnily enough when I was younger I really felt Monica was being unreasonable in that episode!\\n\\nUpdate: Thank you for all the responses and advice. I‚Äôve had more than I expected so can‚Äôt reply to them all. I may have accidentally painted my fianc√© in a worse light than I meant to. He‚Äôs not being a ‚Äògroomzilla‚Äô about it, and we have discussed it and he does understand and respect why, I just also know he‚Äôs upset/disappointed about it also so I do feel guilty and was questioning if I was making the right decision. He is also aware that he should have made more of an effort to save for his/our future.\\nI am going to talk to him about it again and see just how upset he is by this. If he‚Äôs going to regret not having his ‚Äòdream‚Äô wedding I am going to suggest we postpone (we haven‚Äôt even set a date yet) and both start saving into a separate wedding fund to go towards it on top of what I‚Äôve already agreed to contribute. \\n\\nI‚Äôd also add, a few people have said I need to be open to compromise. The amount I‚Äôve offered as my maximum amount is a fair bit higher than I had initially wanted so I do feel I did already offer a reasonable compromise.',\n",

His children (30F and 32M) have drawn back from him and all text messages seem to come across as fairly angry at the change in situation. Needless to say I am sad to see this happening, but i also have little experience with how upsetting a divorce is to an adult child, as my parents divorced when I was 8. \\n\\nOn looking further in to the marriage, the standard was that dad was there to pay for things, and mom constantly berated his ideas and opinions. She had also had several affairs. He was a good provider, but often drank too much early on in the marriage, causing a rift that had never been resolved by the time the affairs began. \\n\\nI personally had left my own abusive relationship after 4 years, with a child of 16 months, and had a difficult few years with my ex while my son underwent heart surgery for a congenital birth defect. After now 8.5 years we are amicable, and are about to have easter dinner (me, bf, son) with my ex and his family, who have always been incredibly supportive of the fact that we need to co-parent regardless of our failed relationship. \\n\\nI have tried to come up with solutions to resolve some of the anger his kids have for the situation, by recommending he meet with them for coffee, start conversations of neutral content, and now finally to meet with us for easter. We received the response that \" until you can think of someone other than yourself  and your own selfish right to be happy, the answer is no, im not interested, and even if i was, you dont deserve it.\"\\n\\nI personally believe everyone has the right to be happy, and to change their life so that they are actually happy, not abused, and not degraded in any way.

Which I am not, she shouldn‚Äôt expect me to change my way of speaking just to accommodate her and her way of life and resort to calling me a bigot just because I slipped up. \\n\\nI was pretty offended to be called transphobic just because I dropped the word ‚Äòbro‚Äô or ‚Äòdude‚Äô once during the night. I wasn‚Äôt using any slurs or derogatory speech towards her, again this is just how I have spoken for the past 20 years. This week we decided to play at my house and I texted in our group chat that she was more than welcome to come, however I wouldn‚Äôt be censoring myself in my own home and if she didn‚Äôt like that then she wasn‚Äôt invited to join. 3 of my friends said that I was totally in the right, however the other two think I‚Äôm being an asshole and could go a couple hours without saying ‚Äòbro‚Äô or ‚Äòdude‚Äô. \\n\\nI feel like that‚Äôs not the point, and I should be able to enjoy myself with my friends, without worrying about using an innocent word and offending someone.  So AITA?',\n",
       " 'So I decided to take my dog to a popular local creek. I live in a fairly large southern city, so it being Sunday, there were many people around. It was about a mile and a half to get to the pool area and there were 2 mid twenties women with 2 dogs in front of me. They were fairly far ahead at first, but they walked fairly slow. I\\'m 6\\'2\\', have a big stride and my dog was pulling me to go faster so I inevitably caught up with them. Once I got 20ish feet away from them, one woman kept looking back with a somewhat concerned look, which I immediately got the feeling she thought I was a creep. Her 10lbs. dog at that point walked towards my direction to greet my dog. I made my dog sit because some people get worried about little dogs being around my 75lbs dog. I had him keep sitting after the little dog was called back to the woman to try and keep some space between us and them as she apparently felt uncomfortable by my proximity to them. This bought me about 10 minutes as the pace my dog was setting caught us up to them again.\\n\\nOnce I was about 20ish feet away from them again I thought, \"Fuck it, I\\'m passing these slow walkers and proceeded to close the space. The women looked like they were taking snapchats, but kept looking over there shoulders at me. At one point, one of the women starts walking backwards, point her phone directly at me, as if she were taking a picture. I was still about 20 feet out, and knew at that point they assumed I was some sort of predator and wanted documentation of my face in case something happened to them? I was both hurt and kinda pissed that I made them feel threatened by simply walking faster than them. At that point I decided I needed to address the situation and announced to them, \" Hey, my dog is pulling me through, is it alright if I pass you guys?\" They said, \"yea, sure.\" After I passed them, I could hear the one woman who turned to take a picture of me say, \" well, I didn\\'t even get a picture of him.\" I was absolutely mortified. Once we got to the swimming area, I made sure to walk to the farthest side of the area to ensure I was nowhere near them. There were probably about 100 people there and I found myself sitting on an uncomfortable ass rock because I wanted to keep my distance from them. I felt uncomfortable the whole time and kept thinking that if they felt that way, maybe I\\'m making others around me feel that way.\\n\\nI am 32 years old, I had sunglasses and a backwards hat on with my beat up vans. I looked like pretty much every other hipster dude in my town just trying to enjoy some solo adventure with my dog, but apparently I either gave off a creepy vibe, or they were a bit overzealous in their actions. I really wanted to confront them about the attempted picture taking, but due to my shy nature and their discomfort, I felt it would have probably made matters worse.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the responses and advice. My shyness comes off as awkward or sometimes creepy in the right situation; I get it. I\\'ll be more assertive and vocal of my passing women on the trails. Talking to strangers is hard for me sometimes. I got told I\\'m TA a handful of times, fewer than I was actually expecting. I received a pretty shitty message from a lady telling me to take a different trail and then it ended by her calling me a creep. [https://imgur.com/a/SpimhZg](https://imgur.com/a/SpimhZg)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd although the general verdict is NAH, I still feel like the action taken against me was a bit extreme. I really think it\\'s more hysteria at play here than rational reactions especially given the foot traffic on the trails that day.  I mean, did the ladies really think there wouldn\\'t be men walking faster than them behind them? I heard some pretty gruesome stories and was told statistics about women being assaulted anywhere from 1 in 4 to 1 in 6. After googling it myself, there seems to be a lot of conflicting numbers floating around out there, I\\'m no expert, but I\\'ll take the advice given here anyway to avoid being in the predicament I was that day.',\n",

My uncle likes to wind me up because I'm in my mid twenties and have no kids or husband, these things dont bother me, but they are dissected at every family gathering. It doesnt get heated, just a lot of sarcasm. This time he was saying how I'd never keep a husband since I refuse to cook all the time. I told him I'd just have a house husband since my degree will pay well enough. After some back and forth he got his words mixed up and instead of saying 'boyfriend' he said 'girlfriend' which I said that would be even better since she'd obviously cook(/s). I am bisexual, my family is unaware of this except my mother and sister. My uncle said if I was gay that was fine, as long as I was happy (surprised me bit in a nice way). My grandmother chimed in very seriously that it was NOT OK for me to be gay because of her religion. I told her to calm down and touched her shoulder when I said it. She physically recoiled and said 'dont touch me' like I was trash, but she almost immediately realized she overreacted and tried to back pedal then went on a tangent about how she doesnt want to be touched by gays and that it was a knee jerk reaction and she knows I'm not gay. She still doesnt know I'm bisexual but that shit hurt. I talked to my sister and she said I should think about things from gram's point of view. I said I did and its a shitty viewpoint and I will not put myself around it. She says I'm taking it too personally because if gram knew I was bi she'd be nice to my face at least about it and that I should really consider that her religion makes her genuinely worry for my soul if I were gay. I say that's not good enough and I dont need to excuse her bigotry even if she is older or christisn. AITA?\",\n",
       " \"Hello,\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI wanted to ask: AITA for charging a deaf person for the internet bill they caused me?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLast month I took part in a retreat. The location's internet didn't work, so we all just had our mobile data. There was a deaf participant from Russia, and he couldn't access the mobile network with his phone. So he asked me if I could give him access through hotspot so he can communicate with his family.\\n\\nI have limited mobile data, I get 500mb per month and from there on, I pay 5 bucks for each 100mb (it's pretty expensive here). I only use mobile data for WhatsApp and maybe sometimes to check my schedule. \\n\\nSo I agreed to give him hotspot under the condition that he only uses it for WhatsApp. No videos, no excessive photo transmissions because it's limited. He agreed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBut when I got lasts month bill I was kinda shocked: he apparently used over 6GB additionally. I was able to track it down to him because this huge amount of data was consumed during these two retreat days. But before confronting him via Facebook, I asked a friend who was his roommate, if he noticed anything. He told me that this Russian guy did sign language videochat the whole night through with his parents. I asked my friend if he had the impression that it were an emergency, but he said that their chat seemed very lighthearted and included lots of laughing.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo I don't know what to do. The bill is over 60 bucks, my budget doesn't really allow it. And I told the deaf guy in advance to only use WhatsApp, but I didn't get a warning that he was using so much data, so he maybe didn't even realize it. In addition, my friend told me that I should give him the benefit of being disabled where videochatting is often the easiest way of communication...\",\n",

Like wasn\\'t he just a gay man who couldn\\'t admit it?\" I replied, \"Not necessarily. There are a lot of bisexual men that aren\\'t \"gay but don\\'t want to admit it.\"\"\\n\\nShe gave me a bit of a weird look so I felt compelled to tell her that I am bisexual. And then she got quite upset. She said I should have told her and all, and that I\\'ve lied to her and that I was an asshole for not letting her know.\\n\\nI understood where she came from, I just didn\\'t mention because I felt it didn\\'t have any effect on our relationship. I was clearly wrong. I will admit it that I have also avoided saying it because I\\'ve been prejudiced by women in the past for being bisexual. \\n\\nAnyway, I\\'ve finished by saying that it only bothers her because she\\'s homophobic. It was a bit abrupt but it\\'s true imo. There are no reasons to not be with a bisexual men just because he\\'s bisexual other than homophobia. We haven\\'t really spoken since.\\n\\nEDIT (adding some info that is relevant): I am a monogamous man. I also had a full panel STI check before our sexual relationship and told her that. I\\'ve never had MSM (too nervous), but have made out with quite a few men if that\\'s relevant. So when I meant that it wouldn\\'t have an effect on our relationships, it was in terms of health risk, her ability to give blood, whether I\\'ll \"miss men\", etc. Really, it should only affect her if she were biphobic imo.\\n\\nEDIT 2: I also realize that homophobic was probably not the right word, and that biphobic would have been more appropriate. English isn\\'t my first language and I simply didn\\'t know the term until today.\\n\\nEDIT 3: We talked and she confirmed that she wasn\\'t comfortable with the fact that I was attracted to men, too, so I preferred ending it.

Last night though, not many people showed up. All but my parents and my uncle said they would not be coming for one reason or another (most had pretty good excuses to be fair to them.). Because of the possible low turn out my parents asked me to come and I agreed. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLike we expected, very few showed up. Only me and my parents along with my uncle and his two kids. Enter Jay. Jay is my cousin. She\\'s 19 and she is just finishing up her first year at university. I had been close to jay but according to her brother, she has become super \"pc\" since entering into academia. I understand this. I\\'m half way through my masters program right now and along with being gay, I have seen how sensitive some people can be. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe night started normal as my grandmother finished dinner up. Me, my dad, and my grandpa decided to have some drinks before and talk. One of the jokes my grandfather always would make is that I will make a good housewife one day to a fine business man (He\\'s not homophobic. He\\'s one of the most caring men I know. This joke comes from the fact I made it when I came out and he won\\'t let me live it down). My cousin heard this and came into the room to tell my grandfather that was \"insanely inappropriate and homophobic.\" and that he \"should be ashamed he would treat his grandson like that\". Things got really awkward after that and we just drank in silence till dinner. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen dinner finally came and we sat down. My grandmother wanted to say grace but my cousin asked if we could to a \"non-denominational prayer\" instead. I scoffed at this and told her to \"lighten up\" because she was acting like an \"entitled millennial princess\". She got mad at me and tried to tell me about how I\\'m being \"inappropriate\" but I shut her down and told her to \"fuck off with that PC bullshit\". She ended up leaving the table and sitting in the living room while we ate. Her parents left with her pretty quickly after. Before they did though, she sent me a text saying that I had \"internalized homophobia\" and I needed to \"educate myself\". I showed my uncle this and he only apologized before leaving. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI don\\'t really feel bad and my dad says I did the right thing, but my mom thinks I over reacted a bit.

       " \"A little background and context.  Fairly standard relationship, with things turning a bit adventurous half way in. We explored the swinging scene and had some fun with others. We also let each other meet others solo, but it was on a permission basis - She took a friends-with-benefits relationship, with very strict rules - permission and absolute transparency required, and turned it into a full blown affair. I caught her texting him VERY strong love messages, wanting to be together swooning over each other.\\n\\nI caught her 3 times with him. After the 3rd time I was done! Especially when she spent an hour telling me how she never really loved me, never had a connection, didn't try in bed with me intentionally, how this guy showed her what true love is.  She blamed me for EVERYTHING sex related, saying I forced it all on her.\\n\\nFor the past year we've been working towards the divorce.  She is still seeing him and thinks she is being super sneaky. It‚Äôs now 3-4 nights a week and lying to us about it.  I have been documenting all of it, and she has NO idea.  She took off this past new-years eve without telling anyone her plans and spent the night at his house. When we texted her, she said she was at a girlfriends house. She spent half of Easter with him, and didn‚Äôt see 2 of her kids.\\n\\nWe talked about the divorce at one point. She thinks she gets EVERYTHING ‚Äì the contents of the house, more from the house sale, and I get all the debt. She will NOT reason with me at all.\\n\\nRemember I forced her into swinging?  I got a text from a friend saying wife and BF were at a sex party!  Through a website, my friend chatted with them - the BF is sharing EVERYTHING.  Screenshots of the conversation were made and there is enough evidence to prove what she‚Äôs doing.\\n\\nMy wife also believes that I absolutely should NOT tell the kids about the affair, which I would have agreed with if it was something that ended. Now I‚Äôm not sure. My original intent was to just have this information to protect myself. She may make me to the be the cheater and the cause of all this.\\n\\nNow, I'm really considering either going scorched earth and telling my ADULT daughters EVERYTHING (Not my minor son) or threatening my wife that I will if she doesn't knock her shit off and start acting fairly. A lawyer I met with believes that I absolutely should NOT lie to my adult daughters, they have a right to know, especially if they ask. I'm not sure I agree, under normal circumstances. I don't look at the idea of destroying the relationship between my wife and her kids gleefully. That really hurts to think about. But at the same time, I am so FED UP with her behavior, it's disrespectful to EVERYONE around her.\\n\\nWIBTA by first threatening her with this information, and then possibly going through with telling my kids? I think as long as I play nice and go along with all of her demands for settling the divorce, she will not do anything. If I fight her, I'm afraid she will do whatever she can to destroy me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit:  Wow, thank you all for your insight on both sides.  I posted this in anger and am not as irrational as I sound :P  For now, I am saying NOTHING.  I will never tell the kids about the swinging.  I'll let her screw that up herself.  I'm also not going to initiate conversation about the affair and will let them ask questions.  I will NOT lie to them though.  I need to be careful to not become the AH by lashing out, which would backfire on me in a BIG way in court.  I will go out of my way to NEVER use my kids as pawns and just let the extra time I spend with them and love do all the talking.  I just got off the phone with a great lawyer - he confirmed that her demands are absolutely ridiculous and if she were to bring these demands to court, it would NOT go well for her.

She says seeing it on TV or even hearing it from other rooms gives her panic attacks because it feels like he‚Äôs back in her life. \\n\\nI‚Äôve really tried to accommodate her like turning the volume down, using something to block the TV so you can‚Äôt see it from other parts of the room, letting her borrow my sound cancelling headphones, but she refuses. She asks, albeit very nicely every time, for me to turn off the show whenever it airs. The only solution she‚Äôs given me is to go to my boyfriend‚Äôs place and watch it there, but he lives 1.5 hr away and I don‚Äôt want to stay there because I have classes the next morning.\\n\\nI‚Äôve asked the other two guys if I could watch in their rooms but they also politely declined because they don‚Äôt feel comfortable with me sitting in their rooms when they‚Äôre not there (they stay with their gfs on weekends). \\n\\nAITA if I just keep watching the show on our living room tv regardless of my roommate‚Äôs feelings?\\n\\nEdit to clarify: lots of people are asking what I‚Äôve done to help the situation so I‚Äôll clarify the steps I‚Äôve taken so far. \\n\\nOur living room is in a room by itself connected to the side of the house. It‚Äôs not open so you can‚Äôt just glance at the tv from kitchen or wherever, you have to physically step INTO the room and turn around to face the back wall in order to see the tv. \\n\\nWhat I‚Äôve done is I put up bedsheets that block the tv from view even when you step into the room (only way you can see it is if you sit on the couches). I have headphones too so there isnt any sound. My roommate hardly spends any time in the living room anyways because she watches her stuff on her computer in her bedroom. When I‚Äôm watching GoT she‚Äôll come down, ask me what I‚Äôm doing, and then come over and turn off the tv. She knows what time the show is on so she comes down specifically to ‚Äúcheck‚Äù if I‚Äôm watching the show. Im not forcing her to hear or see anything, she wasn‚Äôt even in the room before that.',\n",
       " \"Using a throwaway. \\n\\nSo, there's a FtM trans guy at my school, let's call him Don (since I'm watching mad men, lol) who recently came out as trans. He says he isn't transitioning using harmone therapy or anything of the sort to transition. As a girl, he was a pretty good swimmer on the team who did the 100M. He switched over to the male team. The coach casually told him the competition might be a little stiff (not in a harsh or transphobic way, more just 'you might want to be aware/prepare yourself' way). Don nodded along and said that's okay.\\n\\nBut the way he's been acting recently shows he thinks it's anything except fair. Since our swim team is pretty competitive (we're won state just last year), his times for the 100m fell to near the bottom of the pack. And he's been whining about this, calling it unfair and saying he should get a handicap of some sort. \\n\\nI disagree with this, partially. I do agree that it's unfair that he has to swim with cis guys as a biological female not undergoing transition. But he decided to join the male team, knowing the competition would be stiff. I know it may be have been triggering for him to stay on the girls team, but it's a trade-off: if he wants to be on the male team, he can hardly expect to be given advantages over other guys. \\n\\nOne time, after practice when Don was complaining, I civilly shared my opinion. He got offended at this.\\n\\nAm I TA here?\",\n",

It looks really good...‚Äù Or she waits until I‚Äôm taking a break to ask me multiple times if I‚Äôve finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she‚Äôs begging for scraps.

I've always told her never lie to the Dr. because that's your well being!\\n\\nSo I put in a group text a reminder we're all paying for this monthly expense.  She was upset, said I never asked her and I should pay for it until she's 18.  Her dad reminded me I don't help pay for her phone (he got her on a plan 6 years ago after I said no. He has never asked me to contribute... but that's another story). I sent the screenshot of the original convo between her dad and I where he agreed to splitting the cost. I feel she is growing up and thinking about grown up things and this should be part of her responsibility.  \\n\\nAITA for making them help pay? If it matters I carry the insurance and he does not pay child support.\\n\\nMy 2nd part WIBTA if I gave her boyfriends mom a heads up?  His mom is against them having sex (as am I, but I'd rather them be safe than sorry). My daughter doesn't think I should because it's private... but they're both minors and if something were to happen as parents we're responsible.  If it were the other way around I'd want to be informed.\",\n",

       " 'Throwaway account\\n\\nSo I have been dating this woman, we‚Äôll call her Jane for about 9 months up until the first week of April. 3 months after we met we decided to live together in my apartment after her lease ended, as she did not want to renew it. Everything was good for a while, no real problems, but we had never had sex once while we were together. Near the start of the relationship Jane told me she was not looking for a fling nor was she looking to settle down, which sounded exactly like what I was looking for. There were many times where I dropped hints during our time together that I wanted things to move a bit faster than they were, it felt like we were just friends at many points. Each time she would dodge the question or just say no, and initially I just thought it needed to be taken slow. However, after she had been living with me for 4 months I grew impatient. I paid for the rent in full while she would often help with groceries, gas and toiletries, but she never helped much with rent. I straight up asked her if she was even attracted to me, why was she even with me if she refused to sleep with me? She responded telling me of her early adolescence where she was occasionally abused by her elder step-brother, and because of this she was highly aversive to sex in general. I could understand that, and I had been patient, but I also had expectations that I believed I had made apparent to her, yet she made no effort to acknowledge them. So two months ago I told her I didn‚Äôt want to be together anymore, and that I would help her find another place stay. She responded by berating me for being an Apathetic person who obviously doesn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be abused ( I hadn‚Äôt been abused personally). She even told some of her/our friends, with some being more supportive of me than others. After a month of trying to help her find a place she was actively resisting trying to look for some reason. She asked that we stay together in my apartment as roommates and not lovers, to which I declined since the apartment is fairly small and we would be forced to be very close. Then at the beginning of April her friend stops by and helps her pack up to move into her place for a while, and before leaving they both sarcastically and venomously thanked me for being a typical guy who shamelessly threw out his gf when he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nEdit: since I didn‚Äôt clarify on the financial aspect of the situation, I‚Äôll mention this. I paid for the rent in full with the intent of having her gradually contribute more over time, as she had just started a new job that didn‚Äôt pay as well as her old one did when she had her own place (she is a caregiver to the elderly). She however never offered to help with rent and insisted on continuing to pay for other things instead.\\n\\nEdit2: reading these comments made me want to clarify something else. I wouldn‚Äôt consider my ex to have been a leech, towards the end of her lease her job swap caused her to lose about 1/3 of her monthly income, she couldn‚Äôt renew that lease if she wanted to. I offered up my place because she was very stressed about the situation, and I gladly paid the full rent at first because I wanted to make things easier for her, and she did help with other things. I would say she paid for 1/3 of the household expenses on average. \\n\\nFinal Edit: thanks for all your feedback, I have to say I really didn‚Äôt feel like the asshole in this situation but some of the things I was told by her and some friends made me feel like I could be one. I know 3 months was early to move her in but the situation was rough and it seemed like the best idea. I paid for most expenses initially bc i wanted to support my girlfriend. Prior to her moving in she told me that she would only have sex once she felt %100 comfortable, so I would drop a hint or question every few weeks to gauge her feelings. However, despite spending a lot of time together and really wanting things to work, she never overcame her aversion to sex. So I ended the relationship because I have physical needs and tried being patient, and didn‚Äôt want to live with a woman I wasn‚Äôt in a relationship with. Now I‚Äôm by myself and looking for another woman, and I‚Äôll be certain to establish what I‚Äôm looking for clearly and early on.\\n\\nTL;DR: girlfriend lives with me for several months, refuses sex despite communication and patience, is asked to move out, responds negatively.',\n",

       " 'My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and we\\'ve been long distance the entire time. The distance has been frustrating, but we always made it work. A few months ago, we agreed to plan a vacation where our families could meet each other. I must include that every trip we\\'ve made together, we pay for ourselves. I\\'ve never paid for any of his visits/vice versa. This trip\\'s financial arrangement was just like all the others. Everyone paid their own way.  \\n\\n\\nSo vacation day #1 starts and me, my boyfriend, and his family all are together the first night. My family would be coming a couple of days later. Met my boyfriend\\'s family and they were very nice, but he had one step brother who seemed very stand-offish and kind of passive aggressive. I blew it off, figuring that maybe he was just having an off day. Everything seemed normal between bf and me. We were so happy to see each other and he proudly showed me off to his family.   \\n\\n\\nA few days later, my family members arrive.. I was so excited for them to meet BF, and we arranged to have dinner/hang out that night. I was sharing a hotel room with my family and I helped them settle in before they met him. Dinner time rolls around and my family and I are waiting at the restaurant. I text BF to see if he\\'s running late and no reply. I try calling, no reply. He never shows up. I am worried and continue to try to contact him for the rest of the meal. After a few hours of waiting on him and his family, we head back to the hotel and he texts me saying that he just lost track of the time. I was furious and embarrassed but didn\\'t make a scene because I wanted this vacation to be special. I\\'d figure we could discuss it afterwards.  \\n\\n\\nThe next day we had plans, he broke them. He kept doing this the entire week. He kept posting all the fun he and his family were having without me and it made me feel like shit. The only time he met my family was when we were headed to the airport. I kept having to make up shitty excuses to my family on why he kept blowing me off. It was humiliating.  \\n\\n\\nWhen I got home, I confronted him about how he acted. He acted like nothing was wrong, but finally admitted that his stepbrother kept pushing him around to hang out more and that he just kept losing track of time. I told him how hurt I was, and he basically told me to just get over it and laughed it off.  \\n\\n\\nI tried to put it into his perspective but I just had enough and blocked his number and deleted all of my social media accounts. I don\\'t want to try to rationalize his behavior. He hurt and humiliated me in front of my family and I still don\\'t know WHY he blew me off. Did his stepbro tell him something? I know that I wasn\\'t his sidepiece and I also know he wasn\\'t using me for money, so I can rule those out. Either way, I feel bad for going this far, but I feel like he can just \"laugh off\" my hurt feelings, something is seriously wrong here.',\n",
       " 'Earlier this week, I went to the library to finish some papers I\\'m working on. It was very crowded and most seats were taken because the last-years students had to finish their master thesis in a few days. I arrived a few minutes after the library opened and most seats  were occupied, so I just chose the very first seat I saw.\\n\\n\\nThe library seats are massive big-ass tables with 6 to 8 seats with plenty enough room for students to work. There are individual lights, sockets, just everything you need to work on your own. As I was setting up my desk, I noticed the girl who was already sitting on the opposite side of the desk. I recognized her since she was in one of my classes. I smiled, she smiled back, all good. When I\\'m done unpacking, she takes off her headphones and says \"Hey, uhm, would you mind moving to a different seat? It\\'s just that your face kinda is distracting me\".\\n\\n\\nNow, I have burn scars on the left side of my face. It\\'s not Freddy Krueger-like bad, but more like a 24-year old Sandor Clegane on a good day. I am used to people staring and looking weirdly at me and mocking me, so like the idiot I am, I told her I was sorry my face was a distraction to her, but that I couldn\\'t move seats since there are hardy any other seats available.\\n\\n\\nShe replied with: \"but it\\'s really drawing my attention and I kinda got here first. Hey, don\\'t worry, I\\'ll help you look for another seat!\".\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know why, but the \"I\\'ll help you look for another seat\" triggered me. I know my face (which is, by the way, not really as bad as Sandor Clegane) looks a bit off, but actually wanting me to move to a different seat? Like, I\\'m still human, not some kind of flea-covered dog.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I snapped back that I\\'m staying on this seat (meanwhile, other students are noticing our little discussion) and that she couldn\\'t be *that* distracted, seeing she was listening to music already and had a big-ass laptop in front of her.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe raised her voice, I guess in an attempt rally people behind her and pulled the \"everybody-thinks-you-are-a-freak-why-are-you-even-here\"-card, a classic. I told her that if she wanted to help me looking for another seat, she could just help herself and move away and I sit down at my desk. She calms down after a while and continues working.\\n\\n\\nShe stayed in the library for another 6 hours, I stayed there for like 8, maybe. She threw some ugly glances at me sometimes and sighted whenever I quietly got up to get a book from one of the shelves. During one of these trips, a guy passed my by at one of the bookcases and told me \"why couldn\\'t you just move, you distracted all of us here\".\\n\\n\\nWhich made me think: was I the asshole for not giving in and moving away? I felt like I didn\\'t really raise my voice, but I did notice people were looking at us and couldn\\'t really focus on the things they were doing.',\n",

       " 'My husband values material things highly, and gets upset if something he owns gets damaged in any way. And I‚Äôm not talking large, expensive items. If the spine of a paperback book is opened all the way and cracked, it‚Äôs ruined. He once returned and reordered a DVD from Amazon 4 times because there were minor cracks on the case. This past Christmas, my parents gifted us a new Apple TV. The remote is glass. \\n\\nWe have two boys, a very rambunctious almost 3 year old and a 1 year old. In January, the 3 year old picked the remote up off the couch and dropped it, causing it to crack. I was immediately worried because my husband had been having a terrible week. Let me preface the next few sentences by saying that my husband has never been physically abusive in any way toward me or our children. My husband‚Äôs fuse is short. He is angered easily, and he is not a calm angry person. He screams and shouts and says cruel things. Every little thing the 3 year old did that week was setting him off, and I was starting to see the 3 year old being afraid of him. So I told my husband the baby did it. The baby was in a phase of grabbing and throwing anything he could get his hands on, so it was totally plausible. I had assumed that my husband would realize that a tiny defenseless baby would not have done it out of malice, and that he would be much easier on the baby than on the 3 year old. I was wrong. I should have just told him I accidentally dropped it. He would have been furious with me, but that would have been the end of it. \\n\\nFrom that day on, my husband has shown an obvious and strong favoritism toward our 3 year old. He‚Äôs even said on occasion things like, ‚Äú3 year old is my favorite.‚Äù And, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like baby.‚Äù It has honestly broken my heart. The baby feels everything bigger than his brother, and babies are perceptive. Even my mom has commented that she thinks the baby can sense that his father dislikes him. \\n\\nNow to the event I am asking about. Last night, I was cooking dinner, and my husband was supposed to be getting the baby down to sleep. He was getting a cup of milk ready for baby when I noticed baby was crawling around with the Apple TV remote in his hand. I mentioned it to my husband so he could go grab the remote from baby. My husband responded with something along the lines of, ‚ÄúWhat does it matter? He‚Äôs already ruined it.‚Äù I responded with, ‚Äúfunny story. It‚Äôs actually 3 year old who broke it.‚Äù \\n\\nMy husband lost it. He called me a liar and said that he couldn‚Äôt trust me. He blamed me for his dislike of baby, saying, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have to live with the fact that YOU are the reason I don‚Äôt like baby!‚Äù He then told me that I owed him an apology for lying. I absolutely refused. I told him that I would not apologize for trying to protect my child (the 3 year old). Now he won‚Äôt even talk to me or be in the same room with me.',\n",

On mobile, so shitty formatting is shitty.\\n\\nI\\'m a young single dad (22 with a 5 y/o). Kiddo\\'s mum is, to put it kindly, a deadbeat drug addict who flip-flops between actually attempting to be a decent mother and having absolutely zero contact with our daughter at all. I have full custody and mum gets supervised visits when she can be bothered to show up but aside from that sees very little of our girl. I\\'m also a uni student and I\\'m pretty fucking proud of myself for managing to buckle down and do so well in my degree while raising a kid at the same time. I\\'m blessed that my university provides free childcare for students with kids and that I have an absolutely wonderful upstairs neighbour who is generally super reliable as a babysitter if I need to be anywhere in the evening.\\n\\nMy sister identifies as \"childfree\", which is whatever. She doesn\\'t want kids, that\\'s her choice. She\\'s always been quite standoffish with my daughter and doesn\\'t particularly enjoy spending time around her alone, however she\\'s promised me before that she\\'ll take over in an emergency. A couple weeks ago, I had a night class that is compulsory attendance on my course. My neighbour ended up not being able to look after my kid for this as she had a fall and had to go to hospital (she\\'s much better now if you\\'re worried!). I was stuck for a babysitter last minute, believed this constituted an emergency and asked my sister if she\\'d watch my kid for an hour or so while I attended the class (class is \\\\~45minutes and it takes me \\\\~10minutes each way to get too and from uni.) She flat out refused saying I \"knew how she felt about kids\" and that I should\\'ve been more responsible in finding a backup babysitter. I rang a couple friends but nobody could take my kid on such short notice, and she was sick with a pretty bad head cold at this point so I didn\\'t want to take her to class with me. Ultimately, I ended up having to miss my class. I won\\'t fail because of this or anything, but I will lose attendance marks and it\\'ll bring down my overall grade.\\n\\nI\\'m pissed at my sister. Not like furious, but pretty annoyed. I get that my kid is my responsibility and as a parent I have to make sacrifices, but my sister was home and not doing anything at this point and my little girl was mostly sleeping the entire time I would\\'ve been at class anyway. I know she\\'s not fond of kids, but I wouldn\\'t have asked her if I thought it was a legit emergency. She thinks I\\'m a dick for being annoyed, I think she\\'s a dick for not helping me out. AITA here?\\n\\nETA: wanted to add a couple of potentially salient points. Not trying to sway anybodies judgement here, I get that it\\'s my bad for not having a back up plan, but these are just a couple of things I feel I should\\'ve included originally.\\n\\n* there aren\\'t any grandparents in the picture who could\\'ve helped. My parents are both dead and the maternal grandparents, of their own volition, have met kiddo a grand total of twice in her whole life, both times when she was a baby.\\n* I definitely should have sorted a plan B, even if it\\'s finding a local teenager who does babysitting or something in case my neighbour can\\'t help. Didn\\'t bring it up in the post originally bc I\\'m not trying to have a pity party here or anything, but I don\\'t have much of a support system at all. As I said, kids mum is a drug addict and so was I until I knocked her up. We both agreed to get clean when we found out she was pregnant. I stayed clean after kiddo was born, she hopped straight off the wagon the second she was out of hospital and has no desire to get back on it. All that to say, I burned a lot of bridges and my support system is shitty at best so I struggle to find people to help out with stuff. As I said, not saying that for pity points or to sway anyone\\'s judgement, just clarifying *why* I don\\'t have a Plan B (will definitely take steps to make one in future).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT 2: I\\'ve commented this to a few people now, so I feel I should add it here as I guess it provides some further context to this situation that I skipped bc character count: my sister has *never* liked children. Like never. She\\'s 10 years older than me and didn\\'t play with me at all and barely spoke to me when we were kids until I was like 7 or 8 because she didn\\'t like little kids. She also told me the first time she met my daughter, a few days after she was born, that she wants to be as uninvolved with kids as far as possible. Basically meant that, unless there\\'s an emergency, she won\\'t babysit for me (as established here), she won\\'t lend me money for anything towards my kid unless it\\'s putting food on the table (to be clear I don\\'t expect financial support, but there was a time when I was truly desperate and needed it and she helped me only with bills and feeding myself - was getting nappies and formula from food banks. I\\'m not complaining or trying to be ungrateful for the support she gave her, just giving an example), and I don\\'t take anything emotional or mental health related to her if it\\'s to do with parenting struggles, only if it\\'s something outside of that. This was well established when kiddo was tiny, so I knew what I was getting into, but this is just to prove the steadfastness (is that a word?) of her child free-ness.',\n",

       " 'I was chatting with my friends today and mentioned that I needed to leave soon to get the bus to go to the gym. They asked why I wasn\\'t I going to the gym in the college. I said I only have a 1.5 hour window during the weekdays to go to the gym and the college gym\\'s women-only hours cut into that window so I have to go to another gym.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis started a discussion between our friends as to the \"fairness\" of women-only hours in our college gym. The college forces each student to pay for the gym (I\\'d prefer an opt in situation). My position is that if the college really cared about the safety of women while exercising, they\\'d make 2 separate gyms (one a female only gym and one a male only gym). If the college wanted to have women-only hours, I\\'d prefer for the college to charge the women more for the gym, since they are allowed to use it more frequently. Women-only hours definitely has a sexist implication but, if it allows women to feel safe when exercising and encourages more women to exercise, then I\\'m all for it. However, I strongly disagree with being charged the same rate for a service as someone else but not being allowed to use it as frequently solely due to what\\'s in between my legs.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHalf the group strongly agreed with me and the other half said I was a major asshole, which has led me to asking for a second opinion.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo, AITA?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: Clarification -> women-only hours lasts for 3 hours while the gym is open for 12.5 hours (24%).

I‚Äôve had a few boyfriends (longest relationship lasting a year), but for one reason or another, such as wanting to feel ready, not being able to put it in, not having a place to do it, etc etc, I‚Äôve never gotten around to losing my virginity. I‚Äôve strongly considered a FWBs with some of my guy friends, but they all live with their parents and it‚Äôd just be impossible logistically speaking.\\n\\nNow is a good time to mention that my friend group is unusually close. We share *everything*; how many people we‚Äôve had sex with, who, etc. A few of my friends have slept with each other (at the girls‚Äô house), but it‚Äôs not weird, and it‚Äôs pretty casual. This becomes relevant later.\\n\\nWell I got tired of being a 18-year old virgin, so I got tinder, and swiped. The guys my age just didn‚Äôt interest me; no car, live with their parents, I recognize them from school, etc so I changed my swipe settings to quite a bit older (not to mention, I‚Äôm just attracted to older men) and matched with a guy in his late 30s. I decided to lose my virginity to him and it went okay. He didn‚Äôt really get me off, but it‚Äôs a stranger from Tinder; what do you expect?\\n\\nAnyways because of my underwhelming experience, I decided to sleep with a few more guys. I‚Äôve had 6 total hook-ups, ages ranging from mid 20s to early 40s. One of the guys is now a long-term FWB and one is kinda an unofficial ‚Äúsugar daddy‚Äù.\\n\\nAnyways the reason why I‚Äôm asking is that I casually mentioned to my friend group I‚Äôm no longer a virgin. At first they were all really excited about it and saying things like ‚Äúabout time‚Äù, but when I told them the details, they got all weirded out. A few guys asked why I didn‚Äôt sleep with them, and I told them it was just hard logistically and it could‚Äôve turned awkward anyways. Some dudes said it was inconsiderate to past boyfriends to ‚Äúfuck creepy old men‚Äù and I told them my last relationship was months ago anyways and I don‚Äôt owe exes anything.  Some of my girlfriends said it was really creepy that guys in the mid-30s and 40s were sleeping with me and that they‚Äôre predators and creeps, and that I‚Äôm opening myself to being abused and to stay away from them. They all asked how many times have I done and when I told them, they were *really* concerned for me. I told them I appreciated it, but I‚Äôm an adult and can make my own decisions, and most of them slept with way more than me and it‚Äôs none of their business anyways. One guy said ‚Äúwow, the first dick you take and you gotta start whoring around; you‚Äôre better than this‚Äù which I guess kinda got to me and is the reason I‚Äôm posting here. My friends kinda chastised him for being rude, but it seemed like a lot of them for the most part were in silent agreement.\\n\\nI feel like I should able to sleep with anybody I want, but all of their reactions made me feel weird and kinda shitty about myself.

D countered with them being set on it and there was no way they‚Äôd go back to the other name. They both said I could still name my kid Michael one day. I said I didn‚Äôt want to because I thought it would be weird to have two kids in the same family with the same name. She said everyone would be calling him MJ, so if I just named my kid Michael it wouldn‚Äôt even matter since they wouldn‚Äôt be going by the same name.

Calls him MJ for a while. Then she starts calling him Michael often. Next thing you know, MJ is never used (by anyone) and it‚Äôs Michael every time. I mention that they don‚Äôt call him MJ anymore and how she said they were going to which was a big part of her justification on why I could still use Michael. She brushed it off as ‚Äúhe just didn‚Äôt seem like an MJ and Michael fits him better‚Äù. \\n\\nI understand she was actually about to have a baby and I wasn‚Äôt, but since I told her right after they decided to change to the name I wanted I feel like she should‚Äôve at least been nicer about it or even considered changing it back or to something else. But she instantly shut me down with a ‚Äútoo bad, we picked it‚Äù attitude. It‚Äôs caused a bit of a rift between us. My family is very close, so i see my nephew all the time and it kind of irks me that he has the name I always wanted. I‚Äôm also kind of hurt that my mom took her side no questions asked. \\n\\nSo, AITA?\\n\\n*Edit* Michael isn‚Äôt the actual name. The beginning of the post states the names were changed. The actual name I wanted is pretty unique/unconventional so it would definitely be odd to have two in the same family. Just to clarify.\\n\\n*Edit 2* I‚Äôm sure I mentioned the actual name to her at some point, I just don‚Äôt remember any exact conversations. I‚Äôve liked the name for years so I‚Äôm sure it came up. But regardless, it appears I‚Äôm the asshole here. Thanks for your opinions.',\n",

Bea joined at the start of the school year and Abby says that while things started out okay, she became more uncomfortable as time went on.\\n\\nDuring practice, they'll split up into teams and whatever team Bea is on typically wins. Abby says at least 9 out of 10 times. They vary positions but I'm told when Bea is goalie, the other team never gets any points. She also says Bea is extremely rough when they play, either on the same team or opposing team. Abby has gone as far as saying whoever isn't on Bea's team generally gives up hope of winning so they play poorly on purpose or don't even try and it's killing team morale. It has got to the point Abby tells me she doesn't want to play soccer anymore and to pull her from it, and she's been playing since she was 4.\\n\\nThey all also share change rooms and this is where she gets the most uncomfortable. She said if she can help it (ie. there's spare time between soccer and whatever else is next), she'll wait until Bea leaves or will seek another place like a washroom to change. She says if she sticks around, Bea makes everyone uncomfortable and has even got physical (hugging, smacking, etc I guess in a playful way but Abby doesn't think of it like that).\\n\\nI don't know what the other parents think but Abby says everyone is miserable because Bea is playing. Two people have already left the team and Abby wants out, too.\\n\\nI want to reach out to the school and say my daughter is having issues with the team and maybe learn what the other parents thoughts are. I'd never tell them to kick Bea off the team or anything for the sake of the others, but I'd ask them to evaluate the situation: players being demotivated and leaving the team because of one player isn't good for the team, right?\\n\\nBut would I be the asshole for this?\",\n",

She has another bed  that fits 2 people and I called dibs on it. Claire decided to sleep on the sofa. We all had fun watching movies until Claire wanted  to sleep on the bed  with me.  I felt too uncomfortable because she has a penis and Id personally  rather not share a bed with anyone who has a penis and Im also talking bout cis men too.  I  told my friends what I felt also keeping in mind to be polite to C. I even offered for my friend K to sleep with me and for Claire to take her place. Claire refused and called me transphobic and then started screaming at me and calling me a POS and all of that.  EDIT- K had an air mattress ok\\n\\nMy friends told me to apologise bc I was being mean. However I don‚Äôt think I was obligated to share a bed with her. Yes mentally and legally she is a woman but biologically she still has male body parts and even with cis men I wouldn‚Äôt sleep with them.   They told me to apologise but I said only if Claire apologised for screaming at me. Long story short they kicked me out. \\n\\nTbh I would have left anyways because of the unfairness they showed and how they had no RegArd for my feelings. They didn‚Äôt even bother to hear what I had to say and what I felt uncomfortable with.  I offered a solution to the problem yet Claire still refused even tho we coulda have fixed this ages ago. \\n\\nI‚Äôm always trying to learn and become a better person especially to trans people but seriously I politely declined and she still screamed bloody murder at me. I do understand that trans people go through hardships however what was I supposed to do? Share a bed with her even though I felt extremely uncomfortable. And btw if she had transitioned I wouldn‚Äôt have cared as much \\n\\nI feel like my friends and her loosely tossed around the word transphobic and I didn‚Äôt do anything but I also feel like her and I had a right to feel what we felt.  However AITA?\\n\\nAlso like can y‚Äôall not hate on me\\n\\n\\nEDIT- I‚Äôm not saying she is not a woman like whatever you identify as CIS/TRANS if you have a penis then I‚Äôm not sharing a bed with you.  Seems to forget that I have my own personal boundaries  too. Just like everybody else.\\n\\ny‚Äôall are probably way older than me so how can u expect me just to have Somebody with a penis in the same bed as me.\\n\\nEDIT- It‚Äôs the next day and this is what I‚Äôve decided to do. I will agree that I was TA for not offering to sleeping on the air mattress instead and I will apologise to Claire for that only since the bed could fit 2 people. I will not apologise for being uncomfortable with sleeping with her. It doesn‚Äôt matter what gender somebody is, I won‚Äôt sleep with anyone who has a dick. It‚Äôs my body and my choice and I don‚Äôt understand how I am a transphobic. I would be a transphobic if I wouldn‚Äôt sleep with her bc she has a dick but would sleep with other cis men. ( not saying she is a man). I completely understand why she would be offended, my intention wasn‚Äôt to offend her. Instead of listening to what I had to say, my friends and Claire overlooked my situation and basically didn‚Äôt even care. Believe it or not this actually hurt my feelings especially with Claire screaming at my face. I said I was uncomfortable and I can‚Äôt believe that I am faced with backlash for not want to share a bed with somebody.

       " 'I\\'m a 29F, my boyfriend is a 30M. We\\'ve been living together for two years in a little studio in a very expensive, big US city.\\n\\nMy boyfriend grew up rurally, with lots of space, enough to collect all kinds of things. He collected action figures and video games and all the normal kids\\' stuff when he was young, but as he grew older, he became interested in more unusual things. As a teen, he had eight guinea pigs, of different types from different breeders. Since Tide Pods were released seven years ago, he\\'s saved one of every kind of Tide Pod. He\\'s got a big box of an international variety of electric insulators, those little ceramic hats that power lines wrap around on power poles.\\n\\nHe\\'s not a hoarder. He\\'s usually neat, just used to having lots of space for his bizarro collections. At his parents\\' ranch, he has two big rooms full of containers of weird (and impressive!) things.\\n\\nHe recently became interested in Yogurt. He\\'s always hated dairy products, until about a year ago. He not just started drinking milk and sharing ice cream with me, but he\\'s found a love for yogurts. So he now collects them, of course. The problem is that they\\'re perishable.\\n\\nSo, until earlier today, our little 550 sq foot studio contained about 2100 cups of yogurt. It comes in tons of varieties. Different types, flavors, textures, containers, made by different companies in different countries. This is like crack to my boyfriend. So he tried to pretty much save a sample of everything he could find.\\n\\nHe filled our fridge, bought a new fridge, and then another tiny bedside fridge (he said he didn\\'t want to walk to the fridge at night, but it was obviously a ruse to get more yogurt space). These fridges all filled up with his yogurts, and if you keep them for long, they smell bad. Sometimes the packaging breaks. So our apartment was smelling like rotten milk for the last two weeks -- and my boyfriend\\'s attitude was \"oh it\\'s fine\" and \"just deal with it for a little longer\" until I pulled the plug and threw it all out this morning. I was looking at my groceries, which I had to put beside the fridge because there was no space, and everything smelled like death, and then I kinda snapped and threw it all away.\\n\\nMy boyfriend is understandably upset. We\\'ve been arguing about whether I crossed a line by throwing away his stuff. And he\\'s especially upset because he (of course) had rare yogurts that were hard to find -- in particular, he had some Cuban and Iranian yogurts that you can\\'t get in the US. But I know that we have trade sanctions against Iran and Cuba, so I don\\'t know if it was even legal for him to have them? I asked where he got his Iranian yogurt, but he kept insisting \"the Iranian Yogurt is not the issue here\" and that the real issue was me throwing out his precious yogurts without his permission.\\n\\nAm I The Asshole Here?

       " 'Roughly one and a half years ago I got new neighbors. They moved into the apartment right below mine (I live alone), with a newborn baby. Shortly after they moved in (Oct \\'17) the baby started screaming, not just crying, screaming several times a day, every day. You should know, that I grew up in a big family. I\\'m used to noises around me. Even really loud stuff never really disturbed me in my peace.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAt that time I worked full-time in retail, which meant that most of the time I worked all day and when I came home I was super tired and just fell asleep right away. In other words, I didn\\'t notice the screaming very much. That changed as soon as I started studying (Sept \\'18). I was more at home and the time I spent at home wasn\\'t just for relaxing. I have to work from home quite a lot. So not only did I notice the baby more, it also felt as if the crying became more frequent and (I don\\'t know how else to describe it) more painful. The crying didn\\'t just sound like \"I\\'m cold\", \"I want my mom\" or whatever, but more as if the kid was in pain (I\\'m pretty sure the parents didn\\'t actually do anything to their baby, that\\'s just what the crying sounded like).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt got so far, that I simply couldn\\'t work at home anymore (Dec \\'18). I got myself a membership-card for a really nice library nearby, where I at least could study.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSadly the baby would start crying at (seemingly) random times every day and night. Around February this year I got so incredibly annoyed and irritated by the non-stop mayhem downstairs, that, whenever the baby was having one of it\\'s episodes, I simply started shouting \"PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP\". But that degraded to a simple \"SHUT THE F\\\\*CK UP ALREADY!\". I know this definitely wasn\\'t the best approach, but to be honest, I just couldn\\'t take it anymore. What made it even more irritating, is that the screaming didn\\'t stop until I made myself heard. Almost as if the parents didn\\'t care about their kid, until they realized that someone can hear them, but that\\'s just speculation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFor me it got to far, when my sleep schedule got heavily affected by the constant screaming, and I actually failed one of my exams because I didn\\'t get any sleep the night before.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nToday I decided to call the Department of Children and Families \\\\[DCF\\\\], because I\\'m genuinely not sure whether the baby is taken care of, plus I\\'m simply desperate.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe guys from the DCF came right away, and only minutes after they left, the mother came knocking on my door.

We always use protection etc. so I can only assume it must have been a defective condom because I don‚Äôt believe she would be the type to cheat.\\n\\nAnyway, I suggested abortion to her as an option since neither of us are financially in a position to raise a baby and I can‚Äôt speak for her but I‚Äôm definitely not in an emotional position to do so either. However, she refused to hear it saying it was immoral and illegal and murder etc. (it turns out she has been reading exclusively pro-life media about this for a while). Anyway in short she said refused to talk about it or even listen to me when I tried explaining how the situation wouldn‚Äôt work and instead said I should be supporting her instead of trying to change her mind. She also said she had already told her family and if I didn‚Äôt want it I should just leave. When I asked her about how it would work she basically said she expected me to drop my degree and the last 4 years of my life to support it.\\n\\nI should also note that she has wanted a baby for a long time and has talked about it a lot over our relationship. I talked with her and got her to agree that we would try later when we older and both ready before but now I‚Äôm not sure if she just lied to me then when she agreed. Now she says she‚Äôs upset with this situation and scared but I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs lying again as outwardly she seems over the moon about everything and couldn‚Äôt be happier (this also makes me a little suspicious on the broken condom)\\n\\nI don‚Äôt want to throw away my youth raising a child when I‚Äôm 21 but she won‚Äôt listen to me at all (a bunch of other people in her family have had children young as well and all are now single parents). I feel like my only remaining option is to do what she said and just leave. Tell her I can‚Äôt change her mind on abortion but if she wants to raise a child she will be doing it on her own because I‚Äôm not ready to do that at 21.\\n\\nI just want to know WIBTA if I do this? Thanks reddit\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nThanks for the comments so far. I think I should clarify a few things:\\n\\n1. When I say leave I mean leave HER not completely abandon the child. What I would do is leave but still financially support what I can as well as help to look after it. \\n\\n2. We had discussed kids beforehand and both decided to wait until at least 28\\n\\n3. I know I cannot force her to get an abortion nor would I want to. This decision is based on the fact that she didn‚Äôt even consult me about the decision and refuses to even discuss it with me, completely cutting me out of the decision making process. It‚Äôs also based on the fact that she basically laid out an ultimatum for me which was ‚Äòdrop out of school to support us with a full time job or two, or there‚Äôs the door.',\n",

       " 'I (24M) recently showed up \\'unsolicited\\' to a couples event my fianc√©e (27F) was invited to \\'in a professional capacity\\'. She is currently very pissed at me.\\n\\nMy fianc√©e is an attorney. She\\'s been working at a firm for some time since graduating law school. Every year the local bar association organizes this event where attorneys from the area are invited to network and see some old palls from college. The invitation also goes out to the partner of said attorney.\\n\\nLast year I went together with her and had a merry good old time. I saw some guys there, who also work at her firm, that frequent the performance engine shop where I work as a mechanic. We share similar interests and we pretty much hit it off immediately (we still hang out every now and then). The event got pretty rowdy towards the end (contrary to popular belief a lot of these attorney types aren\\'t the goody two-shoes they pretend to be) and I (amongst others) ended up on stage singing to classics such as Journey\\'s \\'Don\\'t stop believin\\'\\' (fucking love that song). \\n\\nHowever, my fianc√©e ended up experiencing that night very differently. She pretty much went off by herself during the entire thing. She told me she spent the night networking with a few established attorneys and some old acquintances. She also told me she got a bit embarassed by my actions towards the end and that she would like to put on a professional demeanor in front of her colleagues and expected that of me too. \\n\\nNow, mind you, we often go off the deep end in the weekends and she doesn\\'t have a problem with me acting like the fool I am then!\\n\\nSo last week when I mentioned how excited I was to go with her again this year, she flat out rejected me! She told me I wouldn\\'t be able to properly behave myself in front of her fellow members of the bar and that was that. I tried promising her that I would be on my best behavior, but \"No means no!\" was the final answer. \\n\\nWhy would you be embarassed of going to an event with your significant other just for being the person he is? Certainly if that very partner promises to be as innocent as grace itself! The event is literally meant for couples...\\n\\nInitially I wasn\\'t gonna go, but my newfound friends whatsapped me and I thought \"to hell with it\". So I got there early, joined up with them (saying she was gonna run late), texted her, had a few drinks, and when she arrived almost got dragged out of the party.

       " '[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/beaaz7/aita_for_refusing_to_apologise_to_my_sister/)\\n\\nSo my sister\\'s wedding was today. I took the advice of people here and apologised to keep the peace/make things easier for my mum, but told her that my partner and I are kind of a package deal and that either both of us come or neither of us do. She stuck to her guns and said that my partner wasn\\'t welcome, at first maintaining that it was because of his tattoos and then eventually getting emotional and yelling at me that he wasn\\'t allowed after \"what he\\'d done to her\", which confirms my theory that it was because he rejected her years ago. I just calmly kept telling her that if she didn\\'t want him to come then fine, but not to expect me either. \\n\\nI guess she thought I wasn\\'t being serious, because I got a call from my mum shortly before the ceremony was due to start asking where I was. I told her I wasn\\'t coming. I got a *lot* of rather abusive texts from my stepfather, telling me he always knew I was worthless but this was a new level, as well as some direct threats. I ignored them all, though I did text mum and apologise for causing problems but I *did* inform my sister I wouldn\\'t be going. Culminated about an hour ago with my stepfather and now brother in law showing up drunk at my flat and trying to fight me while my sister cried outside. They got removed by building security, and honestly it was more funny than anything to me. Apparently I\\'ve ruined her wedding day, but I\\'m really struggling to care. Maybe that makes me now the asshole, I can accept that. \\n\\nJust thought I would share this update, since I posted about it here initially.\\n\\nETA: clarifying a couple of things that people seem confused on.\\n\\nFirst the whole \"she got rejected by my boyfriend\" thing. This one is my fault, I thought I\\'d included the story in my original post but looking back it was actually in the comments, so apologies for any confusion there! Essentially what happened is that about 6 years ago, when he was 17 and she was 26, she propositioned him for sex (~~don\\'t blame her he\\'s hot as fuck~~ that was a poorly worded joke that fell flat, striking it out since some of y\\'all got triggered) and was told no. She\\'s held a grudge ever since - I think, in part, because she was told no for pretty much the first time in her life and also later because he chose to get with me when he\\'d said he wasn\\'t interested i her. He was fully out at the time she propositioned him and she was definitely aware he was gay. \\n\\nSecond, some people are seemingly confused and thinking this whole thing was a one off incident that led to me not going to the wedding/wanting to lessen/cut contact with her. This is not the case and is again probably due to a lack of communication on my part so again, apologies. I\\'ll clear up that we\\'ve *never* has a good relationship, and she\\'s been pretty cruel to the point it could be considered emotionally abusive to me since I was very small. She\\'s also been physically abusive at several points throughout my life. This is not a debate of me placing my relationship over my family but, rather, one of me finally taking up for myself after years of being a pushover and the aftermath it\\'s caused.',\n",

You know that Host isn‚Äôt going to say no to anyone and you‚Äôre just being mean to get your way.‚Äù\\n\\nI told Kim , ‚ÄúJust cancel the order, get whatever you want. I‚Äôm out‚Äù and turned around and drove back home. To clarify, I wasn‚Äôt upset about not getting my choice of food, but at the fact that Kim not only invited herself to what she knew was a guy‚Äôs night and then started making demands about food for us and telling me to pick up the food that she wants when she was also off of work at this time. Kim is a bit of a spoiled princess that‚Äôs used to getting everything she wants.\\n\\nSo I decided not to go, because if she was already getting this upset over something like pizza, then I don‚Äôt want to spend one of my nights off around her. None of the guys were upset, they wanted me to come but understood why I bailed. One last thing is we all hang our pretty regularly as a group anyways. So Kim sees us all once every week or so anyways. It's not that the guy's never get to see each-other, but we just haven't had a guy's only night in nearly a year.\\n\\nAm I The Asshole for not just going along with this to have a peaceful evening?\",\n",
       " \" \\n\\nThrowaway account: Some time ago, my sister asked my then girlfriend (let's call her Nicole) to be a bridesmaid in her wedding which Nicole accepted. Shortly after she was asked, Nicole and I separated. A few months later, I started dating someone else. We'll call her Julia. My sister invited Julia to the wedding but I thought if Julia came, she would have been sitting right next to me, in the front row, on my sisters side. Therefore, Julia and Nicole would literally be 10-15 feet away and facing each other during the ceremony and that would have not been comfortable for anyone. So Julia and I decided she would not come to the wedding.\\n\\nWedding day. After the ceremony, my sister comes to me and says that Nicole is not staying for the reception and is leaving right after the speeches which would be around 9 p.m. So she wanted me to tell Julia to come for 10 p.m. and have a bit of fun, which I did. 10 p.m. rolls around and Nicole is still at the reception. Julia walks in and comes and sits with me.\\n\\n10 minutes later, another bridesmaid comes to my table telling us that we had to leave. Saying It's disrespectful to Nicole that Julia is there, Nicole is very upset, this is about my sister and disrespectful to her wedding, blah blah blah. I instantly became furious and stood up and told her it's none of her fucking business and she has no right to be telling us to leave. I also said that if Nicole has a problem with Julia being there, then she should grow up or she can leave. My sister stood and watched as this transpired which only infuriated me further, thinking she should at least say something, since she was the one who invited Julia. I asked if she was going to allow this to happen and if she wanted us to leave then we would. She didn't say a word so I grabbed Julia's hand, told my sister that if she would prefer to have my jealous immature ex girlfriend than her brother there, then she can damn well have her. Julia and I then left.\\n\\nApparently that ruined the rest of the night for my sister and apparently I'm to blame. I've had people message me and say how rude I was to my sister for doing that. That I'm an asshole because I made my sister cry on her wedding night. Telling me that I should apologize to her for what I did. Yet Julia and I felt absolutely humiliated.\\n\\nAITA for feeling that I don't owe my sister an apology for what happened and for feeling like we are the one's who deserve an apology?\\n\\nTL;DR: My ex gf who was a bridesmaid in my sisters wedding, got another bridesmaid to kick me and my current gf out of the reception because she was mad and jealous and supposed to have left an hour prior. My sister invited my gf so I don't feel like I did anything wrong and we were humiliated in front of hundreds of people. It ruined the rest of her night and I do not feel like I owe her an apology even though a lot of people blame me.\",\n",

       " \"So as I write this I'm feeding my 7 week old son. I am totally in love with him, he is amazing. However... The process of bringing him into the world was not good. At. All.\\n\\nIn order to explain why i might be an asshole I think its important to explain the circumstances surrounding my sons birth.\\n\\nI had incredibly bad morning sickness, to the point that I weighed less at the end of my pregnancy than before I conceived (my bmi was 23 pre pregnancy). I could barely walk due to bad hips, my stomach muscles tore apart, and I got a ridiculous number of stretch marks all across my stomach and back.\\n\\nThen came labour and delivery. I was in labour for 92 hours. My son was back to back, so i was in agony. I had two failed epidurals, ended up on gas and air, paracetamol, and morphine, and still spent hours screaming into the abyss. In the end his heart rate dropped and I had to have him delivered in theatre by ventouse.\\n\\nI ended up with a second degree vaginal tear, which got infected. My son was ill following delivery and ended up in the NICU for a few days. I had issues breastfeeding once he was out of NICU, and ended up getting mastitis twice within a week, before my milk supply dried out totally. I spent 12 days in hospital total before going home.\\n\\nOnce home my son got ill again and ended up back in hospital on three occasions.\\n\\nHe's finally better and we are finally a normal happy family at home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo why AITA?\\n\\nWell, before I got pregnant / gave birth people would tell me how magical pregnancy was and how giving birth wasn't that bad and that you forget the pain as soon as you hold your baby etc. Which, pardon my French, is bollocks. I still remember every moment of pain and currently don't believe I could mentally deal with another pregnancy.\\n\\nPart of the reason I think I have struggled so much emotionally with all the issues I had was that my experience totally jarred with my expectations. Nobody told me that everything can go wrong. I didn't expect my birth plan to go as I hoped, but i thought I might get some things I wanted. I never expected to have such difficulties feeding my son. I didn't prepare for him being ill. I didn't prepare for feeling totally helpless and useless.\\n\\nSo when my childless friends (who planned on having children in the future) asked me how labour and delivery went, I was totally honest.\\n\\nI didn't sugar coat anything. I explained everything exactly as it was, and told them of the problems we had as they happened. I have been very honest in saying that whilst my son was worth all the pain, I probably won't be doing it again.\\n\\nWell my friends have said that I'm an asshole for being so honest as I've put them off having children in the future. I didn't mean to scare them, but I felt that I would have rather had more realistic expectations of what could happen.\\n\\nI don't feel like I should apologise or say that I exaggerated anything to make them feel better, but maybe I'm wrong.\\n\\nSo reddit AITA?\",\n",

This is something we have talked about at length for several years, and during that time I have always had the same views on children; I don\\'t want them.

It\\'s not happening for me, and I have made that very clear to my wife since we were 16.  \\n\\nOn her end, however, she has flip-flopped on this issue many times, but the majority of the time she has sided with me on the no kids front.

       " 'Unfortunately, the title is as silly as it sounds, and this post isn‚Äôt going to make any sense of it. Basically, for as long as I‚Äôve dressed myself, I‚Äôve always put on two pairs of underwear. I don‚Äôt know why it started, but I‚Äôve been doing it for a while. I‚Äôve tried to break the habit, but every time I try, I feel physically uncomfortable and just don‚Äôt bother.\\n\\nNow, I‚Äôve been with my wife for 3 years and married for 1. Until recently, she did not know I had this habit. This Friday night, we were getting ready to have sex and we were both kind of stripping down, but in a corny and silly kind of way. We were both being very dramatic about taking off our clothes, and once I took my pants, I sensually took off the first pair of underwear slowly before taking off the second. She completely burst into laughter, and found the whole situation hilarious. She told me that I had way too much dedication to this sensual stripping but we were doing, but then I told her that the two pairs of underwear wasn‚Äôt part of the bit, and I actually do that normally. She didn‚Äôt believe me at first, and it took some pestering for her to finally realize I wasn‚Äôt making this up. She said we‚Äôll talk about this later and we continued on with our sexual activities, however, I did notice some subtle signs of her being slightly less affectionate.\\n\\nAnyways, yesterday we wake up, and all day she‚Äôs questioning everything about my habit. She brings up things like how it doesn‚Äôt make sense because I go through twice the amount of laundry, how it‚Äôs uncomfortable, and how there probably isn‚Äôt anyone else in the world who does this. I understand that what she‚Äôs saying makes sense, but again, I mentioned to her that I tried to kick the habit and was very uncomfortable doing so, so I just stopped trying. She tells me that I barely gave it a chance, and that it just makes zero logistical sense to wear two pairs of underwear. I told her it isn‚Äôt hurting anyone.\\n\\nAfter this initial argument, she continues to complain to me about this issue. She starts getting gradually more angry about it as the day goes on, and what started out as playful ribbing turns into heated argument. She starts bringing up how it‚Äôs gonna be a total turnoff in bed now because she won‚Äôt be able to stop thinking about it, and she starts calling me a weirdo, which definitely hurt me. I know she‚Äôs probably doing it to get me to stop wearing two pairs of underwear, but it still hurts regardless. The argument just keeps going in circles until I just say that I‚Äôm done talking about it. She remains very angry for the rest of the night and basically doesn‚Äôt talk to me and we just get into bed silently that night. It‚Äôs this morning now, and she‚Äôs not awake yet, but I‚Äôm really starting to question whether I‚Äôm actually in the wrong here or if she‚Äôs overreacting and making a big deal out of a minor issue. AITA?',\n",

       " 'Some context - I\\'m a SAHD.  When my wife and I first met, she was a huge workaholic and was always chasing her career.  I was fine with it; if it made her happy, who was I to judge?  I\\'m more of the artistic type, not a 9-5\\'er, lol.  We got along really well; even though I\\'m not ambitious in a career sense I\\'m definitely a clean freak and I actually like doing household chores and repairs.  When we moved in together it was great for both of us.  She suddenly had someone to do all that other stuff for her so she could focus even more on her career, and I got to trade my crappy low-paying job for taking care of a home and selling my art.\\n\\nThe one thing we didn\\'t really agree on was kids.  I definitely wanted kids, being a father was my dream.  She wasn\\'t sure - she liked the *idea* of kids, but she said that women especially end up really losing out on career advancement because of them.  So she mostly said she didn\\'t want to have any.\\n\\nWe talked more and more about it, never fighting, just talking about things as our lives changed, and eventually we got married.  Then we started talking more in earnest; I still really wanted them, and she was still adamant that she didn\\'t want to make the necessary sacrifices.\\n\\nEventually she said \"I would only have kids if I knew you could take care of them 100%.  I can provide all the money we need for the household (it was true, she makes great money, never a problem there), but only if I can concentrate fully on my career.  I don\\'t want to have to do any kid-related chores.  I\\'d love to be a mom and do family stuff together, but all of the actual chores, housework, etc. still has to be on you.  If you don\\'t want that, we can\\'t have kids.\"\\n\\nI thought that was really really selfish, but if that\\'s what it took to have kids, I definitely wanted to be a dad.  So I agreed.  She seemed shocked that I would, and it took some time to convince her that I was really serious.  But we agreed, and she got pregnant.  She worked almost all of her pregnancy, and even for the last few weeks she worked from home.  Even after the delivery she was working from home again immediately.  She nursed for a little while working from home, but then we switched to formula and she was back to work.\\n\\nOur son is now 7 months old, and my wife refuses to help in any way.  I can\\'t do any of my art because I\\'m constantly tending to him.  I keep the house mostly clean, but if I ask her to come home a little early from work 1-2 nights per week to help she refuses.  On the weekends she\\'s home, but she has a lot of projects for her job so she\\'s on the phone or in front of the computer a lot.  We eat dinner as a family, but almost immediately after she sleeps since she\\'s usually up at 5 AM to get to work.  I\\'m tired of being the only one parenting.  I\\'m at the end of my rope.  Am I the asshole, or should she parent more?\\n\\nEDIT:  I should make this clear:  It\\'s not that she doesn\\'t want anything to do with him. She actually spends a lot of time with him; when we eat dinner together (which she almost always makes a point of doing), she sits him on her lap and plays with him, she carries him when we go for walks, stuff like that. Like, when she\\'s home she\\'s all about him. She just won\\'t help with chores or anything. Like if he wakes up from his nap crying on the weekend and we\\'re both home on our computers, it\\'s 100% always me that has to get up and take care of him, instead of splitting it equally.  She says it\\'s because she\\'s actually working and I\\'m not, but I don\\'t see how that makes a difference.\\n\\nEDIT #2:  I should clarify the money bit.  She makes good money meaning we never struggle, but we still can\\'t afford a full-time nanny.  That\\'s very expensive.  We could afford day care, but she says she\\'ll only do that if I go back to work, because she says it isn\\'t fair that she has to sacrifice the money she\\'s putting aside for other things just so I can do my art.  And I should note, she\\'s not spending money on dumb stuff, she\\'s actually way better with money than me.  She\\'s very anal retentive about saving and investing and she likes for us to be able to take a vacation each year, and now she also has a long-term college savings account for our son.  All that would take a hit if we put money into professional child care.',\n",

Our years has been up and down in conflict, and we have had our fights over issues.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSince the start of our relationship, when we went out drinking with friends, we all started playing \"Never have I ever\". She told everyone about the several times she has slept with different people in different situations. for example, \"I poked him on the shoulder, and then we ended up in bed\", and \"I was heading on a afterparty, but then this guy asked me to join him home, so I did\". If you make those examples and add 30 different ones, you have it all (that I know of)\\n\\nWhen she first told them a couple of them, It was entertaining, who has not slept with other people when you are close to their thirties, right?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter the eight story, I felt at an unease, thinking that my girlfriend was sharing too much, and that she was putting herself in a bad light, and that I felt my stomach churn for each new story she told. I took it up with her, that I thought and she said, \"its in the past, it does not matter now\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI do agree with that statement, but it still keeps bothering me that she mentions those stories. When all comes to all, I get the impression that she is unknowingly calling her self cheap, and easy to get to bed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI took it up with her today, after she told a entertaining story about peeking on some boys in the shower at high school. When the story finished, she again ended it with, \"he was the worst guy that I ever slept with\". I again felt my stomach churn because of it and saw it as the final straw, so I confronted her with my reasoning, saying that, she gives the impression of being cheap, and easy, and it makes me feel bad. I hope you can respect me enough to try to contain yourself from saying these stories when I am present, as I don\\'t like to hear them and you are putting yourself, and myself by proxy in bad light.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nShe said that she couldn\\'t help herself, and that she blurted these things out sometimes, and that she couldn\\'t guarantee that she did so in the future. I said that it was okay if that happened, but when she did, she could afterwards, say that \"I know you feel bad when I am telling these stories.\" So that it does not bother me so much, and I know she cares about how I feel.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nShe would not listen to that suggestion, and I said, that \"It is not interesting to hear about your past when you once poked a guy on the shoulder, and that made you go sleep with him afterwards. You were acting like a slut\".\\n\\nShe then got furious and angry with me for calling her that, and here I am. Am I in the wrong here?',\n",

Before my sister and brother each had a kid of their own my dog was referred to as \"the first grandkid\" My mom loved her to bits, and every time she came by us, or we went to visit them, she bought toys and dog treats. My dog is a malinois shepherd. Super trained, sweet doofus which grew up with my niece since she was like 2 years old.

Or we arrive later in the day and leave early because of doggy obligations. But the kids are getting bigger now, so I started the conversation on simply the question: When would you guys be okay with me bringing the dog again?\\n\\nThis exploded. At first they assumed that I wanted to bring the dog that day to the family gathering (which was not my intention) And then they all went beserk on me for making my mom cry that day. Simply because I asked for clear answer on where I stood with my dog. Turns out they discussed during christmas (when I couldn\\'t be there because I couldn\\'t get a sitter, and my father in-law was dying, so we\\'re not able to visit) that under no situation whatsoever they wanted the dog near their kids. EVER. Since the dog is a crazy random thing that they are afraid of, and might grab their kids.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nExtra info:I\\'ve been the black sheep in the family all my life.

       " 'So, it was my dad\\'s birthday party yesterday, and his wife (W) threw him a surprise party with a corresponding lobster feed. My girlfriend (GF) couldn\\'t be there for the surprise, but said that her mom would drive her up later. She had asked whether her mom (GFM) could pop in for a few minutes, and I said it was fine. However, GFM had _not_ been invited to the party or the dinner. When they arrived, my dad was the perfect host, and handed GFM a big glass of wine. Mistake number one. \\n\\nAs the cocktail hour wore on, I became increasingly worried that GFM wasn\\'t leaving as GF had implied she would. When people started putting lobsters in boiling water to warm them up, I discreetly mentioned to GF that it was time for her to \"kick her mom out.\" She told me that she would \"leave when it was time for her to go,\" and I trusted her judgement. Mistake number two. \\n\\nWhen we were all seconds from sitting down and GFM was still lingering, W approached GFM and said, \"Okay, we\\'re all about to sit down for dinner now, [long pause, blank stare from GFM] would you like to join us?\" Mistake number three. I guess it\\'s a cultural thing, but I feel like that\\'s where one should say, \"Oh, thank you, but I couldn\\'t.\" However, GFM, being raised by Dutch parents, took W at her word, and accepted the \"invitation,\" exactly the situation that I had tried to avoid putting W in. GF wanted to sit next to me, but I told her that she should sit by her mom at one end of the table and I would sit with my dad at the other end.\\n\\nAfter dinner, I was pretty angry, so I spent most of the night cleaning dishes and avoiding GF and GFM. On the way home, GF asked whether I was angry, and I made it clear that I didn\\'t appreciate her mom staying past her welcome and her not having her mom leave when I asked. She asked why I hated her mom, and I don\\'t, it\\'s just that this is part of a history of GFM missing social cues, and I anticipated this situation. She accused me of not being welcoming, but I\\'m sorry, _GFM wasn\\'t invited_, and lobsters aren\\'t exactly cheap. She noted that everything worked out fine: we found another chair, somebody was allergic to lobster so GFM wasn\\'t taking someone else\\'s, etc., and she\\'s right. But I\\'m angry on the principle of it, and I\\'m angry that GF doesn\\'t see her mom\\'s actions as rude. So, AITA?\\n\\nEdit: To be clear, her presence did bother a few people. GFM and W had met twice before, but GFM didn\\'t even recognize W...the person whose house she was at. She insisted it must be W\\'s hair, but she\\'s worn her hair the same way for years. When I went downstairs to get another chair, I apologized to W that she was staying, and she said, \"Well, I can\\'t uninvite her now....\" Clearly, W had planned a party for my dad, and GFM had not been part of the plans.\\n\\nLater on, my uncle on my dad\\'s side came into the kitchen to escape her for the moment, because she was dominating the conversation on that side of the table, talking about things that nobody cared about.',\n",

She was really happy to start college there this fall, but she has no money. I don\\'t really feel like I have to pay for her college; she\\'s an adult she should start paying for things on her own.

We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. \\n\\nNow if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I‚Äôd have no problem paying what‚Äôs fair.

But what surprised me was that she casually said she got an STI screening. I asked her why she needed to do that as we've only been with each other and she said that she just wants to make sure. I guess I was a little miffed about this as I thought this implied that I could've cheated on her and gave her something, but the more I thought about it I guess it makes sense.

Why can‚Äôt she accept it‚Äôs very important to me?\\n\\nLong story short, when I was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river.

My sister went through an extremely \"sex positive\" phase in college and slept with easily over 100 guys (we\\'re twins btw, so always been close).

I hope you guys get the point. \\n\\nBut I've learned everything, because I'm the only person our daughter has. I love her and she is the only person who keeps me running. My wife has a best friend. Let's call her Sarah. Now Sarah was with my wife so nce childhood. They were really close and her death shook Sarah. Before passing, my wife casually told Sarah that I didn't know much about raising a girl and she was worried about me and our daughter. \\n\\nNow Sarah thinks it's her responsibility to raise my daughter. She gives me unsolicited advice, which seems condescending, buys my daughter gifts and she recently asked me if I could let her watch my daughter when I'm at work. I make more than enough and I can totally afford daycare and a sitter if necessary. And I think interacting with other kids is important. She keeps telling me that my daughter needs someone around to assess her trauma. I think that's our therapist's job and not her's. Also, she gives me the feeling that I'm somehow being neglectful. \\n\\nMy daughter and I are really close. Now, she asks me if we can have Sarah over and make her mommy.

So our math class has 5 students, four who are Muslim and one who isn't. The non-muslim student picked up breakfast before class, and proceeded to eat at her desk. The other aid stated that she needed to put the food away and eat it later, as it is disrespectful to the students fasting for Ramadan. I held the position that the student was well within her rights to eat, and wasn't being disrespectful by doing so. Now this other aid and I really don't get along, so the discussion quickly devolved into me feeling like I was beating my head into a wall. The student recognized that we were subtly arguing and just agreed to put the food away, but that still bothered me.

The executive chef an I have a system for reviewing applicants; I conduct the first interview, and if I think they have potential, I set up a second interview with the executive. We have worked together for years and he trusts my judgement.\\n\\nLast week, I had an interview with a name I immediately recognized, lets call him Jake. Jake was in my high school graduating class, and for the good part of junior and senior year he made my life hell. Now I wasn't particularly popular in high school, but I was never bullied, except by this guy. His favorite thing to do would be to loudly insult me in front of his friends, then force me to leave because I wasn't cool enough to be around his cool friends. This happened at lunch, gym, assemblies, and sporting  events. I distinctively remember one football game where he kept telling everyone how much weight I had gained recently, calling me a fat fuck and making me sit in the bleachers on the other side of the field. I still think about that stuff today to be honest.\\n\\nFast forward 10 years later, and he is sitting in front of me interviewing for a job. I decide to not bring this up, and he never mentions any of it. His interview actually went really well, and he had a pretty good resume. But before we even start talking, I know I am not going to hire this guy.  I finish the interview, tell him I will be in touch, and he leaves. I later call him and tell him we accepted someone else for the position. \\n\\nAs i was driving home I started to feel a little guilty. This guy was definitely qualified, and we don't see too many applicants being in a small town. High school was 10 years ago, I know I was a different person then, and maybe Jake has changed for the better. \\n\\nAm I wrong to judge someone for their actions so long ago? I definitely feel like a bit of an asshole, but honestly if I had to work with him again it would bring up a lot of memories I try not to think about anymore.\",\n",

I told my boyfriend before I left for this vacay that the girls we're talking about skinny dipping and that I wanted to join them. As a kid, I thought that's what all the college kids did and I've never felt like it was overtly sexual. Just something that was fun. I knew he didn't like the situation, but after telling him that I wanted to be young and have fun, we dropped the convo.\\n\\n*EDIT 4: We dropped the convo because he said that he'd be okay with it, even if both men and women were there, under the impression that  we were doing it in the ocean.

One of the guy friends is gay, and the other one is getting married (his fiancee was also in the hottub).\\n\\nWhen I get back home, my boyfriend is very upset about what happened. He kept going on and on about how all those guys 'didn't deserve to see me naked' and how it wouldn't be an issue if I 'weren't so attractive to him.' He said he thought we would be skinny dipping at night at the beach, not in the light, in close proximity to each other in a hot tub. Before the trip, I thought we were skinny dipping at the beach too.\\n\\nWe calmly spoke about it, and I decided that I didn't like seeing him so upset over something like this so I told him he was right and that I was sorry. He was particularly upset at the guy getting married for getting to see me naked. He kept calling it 'the best bachelor party this kid could get'. I didn't fully understand his beef with the married guy but I guess that's why I'm here asking Reddit.\\n\\nAlthough we've talked it through I'd like 3rd party perspective. AITA here?

Long before I even posted here.** Because he and I had such different views, I was curious to see what other 3rd parties would think. My post states that. **Clearly, the comment section is divided over the situation too.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**EDIT 2:** For everyone calling my boyfriend misogynist, he is certainly not. u/veastt 's comment perfectly captured how my boyfriend felt towards this situation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**EDIT 3:** Everyone keeps asking this question so I figure I should put it in the post description:\\n\\n**Q:** *Just wondering, if you found out he went skinny dipping with naked ladies when you weren't around would you be upset?*\\n\\n**A:** I would not be upset if he went skinny dipping with 8 dudes, a lesbian, and a woman getting married with her fianc√©e present (the reverse situation). Not at all. I judged the situation as being non-sexual. If the group of people consisted of several single, straight men, I would not have gone skinny dipping because that would make me very uncomfortable.

Plus I'm tight on money to give him anything more expensive.\\n\\nAfter I gave him the presents at the birthday party he opened it to test it out. Here enters Pretentious Music Snob (PMS), he starts fiddling with the record player, as soon as my friend opened the package.\\n\\nPMS: (asking me) How much did you get it for?\\n\\nMe: 60 dollars.\\n\\nPMS: (friend's name) be careful of the needle. It's a cheap vinyl player and it might scratch the records.\\n\\nI thought that was a weird thing to say, considering that he was right in front of me, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt since it might actually be useful advice.\\n\\nMy friend put on a vinyl and it started playing. \\n\\nPMS: The speakers sound pretty crap.\\n\\nFriend: I think it sounds fine.\\n\\nPMS: You know what you can do? You should take out the speakers from the player and rewire it to better speakers to improve the sound. Here's the setup I have at home. (Pulls out his phone, starts showing him stuff) The one that xxx gave you is like the cheapest record player you can buy so it's not going to give you a good sound.\\n\\nAt this point I was pretty annoyed. He might be right, but I think it's a dick move to straight up say that my gift crap when I was right next to him. So I decided to call him out.\\n\\nMe: Hey look, if you think that my gift is trash, why didn't you get him something better yourself instead of a 20 dollar gift card? (Yes, he got him a 20 dollar gift card for my friend's 18th)\\n\\nThe room became silent and it got pretty awkward. I know that it's the thought that counts and it's bad to compare the value of the presents that you give, me calling PMS out about the value of his gift might be shallow and petty, but I reckon that he deserves it for talking shit about my gift right in front of me.\\n\\nSo AITA?\\n\\nEdit: I posted this before going to bed (I live in Australia) and woke up in the morning expecting like 50 comments but Holy Crap this blew up. Here's some additional info:\\n\\nWhen birthday friend opened the present, everyone gathered around and was watching because we're (mostly) 18 year old who have never seen a record player at work before. So when PMS was pointing out the flaws in my gift, it was to everyone at the party since all the attention was on the record player, and thus him at that moment. \\n\\nTo be honest I'm not a confrontational person and I wouldn't have said anything until the point where he pulled out his phone and showed birthday friend what he thought would be better gifts, that was the last straw for me. I said what I said to A) shut him up, I wasn't in the mood for listening to him saying how bad my gift was for 10 more minutes B) Yes I said it in a way that embarrassed him. I'm not a saint, I didn't take the high road, but I sure as hell feel good about standing up for myself. \\n\\nWhen I said the room went silent and awkward, it was like for 10 second. I've apologised to birthday friend over text for making a scene, he said to not worry about since PMS was also annoying him. \\n\\nI posted this to see if my response was appropriate and that I didn't over escalate it. My conclusion is that sometimes you gotta be an asshole yourself to stand up to a bully and I don't regret what I did.\",\n",

She basically blamed me; she said after our conversation, there was too much pressure on her, so she caved and sneaked a whole sheet of notes into her test. That F, combined with an academic integrity violation, basically ensured that med school won‚Äôt be an option anymore. \\n\\nWhen I found out, I was less angry and more extremely distraught. I apologized for putting so much pressure on her, but told her that being a doctor sincerely isn‚Äôt worth losing her integrity. She told me that a part of her realized I had a point during our first conversation; she likely would not get into med school with her current grades. So she tried even harder to achieve her goals: studying longer hours, using supplemental books, doing endless practice problems. But when she kept getting below the mean on her orgo practice tests, she tried it with notes and got above the mean. She thought it would be a fool proof plan.\\n\\nThis is definitely not the update I wanted to give reddit. Thank you for understanding.\\n\\n\\nUpdate 2: I have a group chat with my daughters. I sent them a link to this suggestion, because I thought it would be helpful: \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bn4hl6/update_aita_for_telling_my_daughter_to_give_up_on/en2xbad/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app\\n\\nMy older daughter found the post and read it. She called me and was extremely upset, and told me not to feel bad for my daughter. Apparently, the reason my daughter was getting subpar grades was because she wasn‚Äôt putting in the effort. She‚Äôd call me and say she spent hours studying and doing problem sets, but really has been partying her ass off and buying study sheets for tests. As I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm dumbfounded and I can barely believe it. I don‚Äôt believe it to be honest. I‚Äôm going to approach my daughter and talk to her about this. Not sure if I‚Äôm updating again.\\n\\n\\nUpdate #3: Daughter and I had a long talk. And it‚Äôs a doozy. \\n\\nSo her freshman year, she actually put in effort. She was trying hard, so those hours of studying weren‚Äôt a lie. However, she had a very traumatic life event that she did not tell anyone about, and spiraled after that. She stopped caring about her classes, thinking she could easily get a job as a doctor via cheating. She did illicit drugs basically daily.  \\n\\nWhen I called her, she realized her lifestyle wasn‚Äôt sustainable (as in she could not become a doctor and would have to put in effort to achieve that goal). But she wanted to continue her lifestyle, so she And then she got caught cheating.  \\n\\nShe told me she doesn‚Äôt even have a passion for medicine anymore, or anything. She is just numb. She says it‚Äôs easy to be happy around her family, because we only see her for a short period of time. But she had been hiding her whole life and sadness from us. To me, this sounds like severe depression. We will definitely be going to individual and family therapy.',\n",

A message from my boyfriend‚Äôs sister to him 2 months ago changed that. His girlfriend from his home town was suddenly claiming that he was the father of her 6 year old son. They‚Äôd split up at 18 when they‚Äôd both left to go to college, and he‚Äôd never heard from her again. Boyfriend‚Äôs Sister had seen the old girlfriend out in the supermarket with her kid, and after a bit of small talk she just casually mentioned that Boyfriend was the father and it was ‚Äòprobably‚Äô time for him to know. Boyfriend goes home ASAP for a paternity test, and lo and behold he is this kid‚Äôs father. A very important note - before this, both of us were child-free in life and mind.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI left everything in my boyfriend‚Äôs hands since I was never going to dictate what happens, but after one ‚Äòplaydate‚Äô he started going on about how he couldn‚Äôt wait for his son to come and visit us in our city and see the sights. I smiled and nodded, and the date was eventually decided for last week.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt was hell from start to finish.

       " 'Two nights ago I was out for dinner with my husband at this new restaurant we‚Äôve been wanting to try for a while. It‚Äôs got a Michelin star so it‚Äôs always packed and the restaurant itself is pretty tiny and spans two floors. \\n\\nWe got a great table on the first floor which is really just a bar, some tiny two person tables, and those standing tables for drinks. We essentially got the only table by the window for actual dining. We got this due to calling nearly a week ahead for reservations. \\n\\nAnyways nearly half an hour into our meal this visibly pregnant woman and her husband comes in asking for a table. They had a reservation but no request for any specific table so when the hostess starts leading them upstairs to the main dining room the woman says no, she can‚Äôt go up stairs in her current state (she looks VERY pregnant). \\n\\nLong story short, they end up approaching us asking if we‚Äôd mind switching tables with them so they could have our ground floor table. My husband is like ok I guess but I simply said no, I called ahead to get this exact table and I want to stay here. The hostess shrugs and the woman and her husband looks pretty ticked off. She rolled her eyes at me and they just left. My husband thinks we should‚Äôve given up our table. AITA?\\n\\n**Edit**: To everyone asking for more details, here‚Äôs a better breakdown of what happened. \\n\\nWe had just gotten our starters and were still anticipating 3 more courses (pasta/main/dessert). We had also ordered an expensive bottle of wine so had no intention to rush the evening. The table I reserved was a bit special because it was the only one set in these huge bay windows that‚Äôs very iconic to this particular restaurant, looks very romantic basically. I had called previously just to ask for this table and was turned down (original date was last weekend but table was taken) but we went midweek instead since we weren‚Äôt in any rush and thought that window table was especially nice. Also the upstairs dining room is sort of grim compared to downstairs (smaller windows, used to be the attic). \\n\\nWhen the other couple came in we didn‚Äôt notice initially until they started whispering to each other and the hostess while staring at us. Eventually the hostess comes over with them in tow asking if we‚Äôd switch tables and they‚Äôd comp our starters. The pregnant woman tells us they drove over an hour to get here to eat and she can‚Äôt walk up stairs because of her knees (it was some medical condition I can‚Äôt remember). My husband and I talked it over and I said no thank you we‚Äôd like the stay here if possible. Honestly I didn‚Äôt expect them to just leave the restaurant. I assumed they would make do and just eat at the other smaller bar tables on the ground floor since they were mostly empty at this time.\\n\\nThis is where the couple kind of huffs collectively and the guy said ‚Äúseriously?‚Äù under his breath and the woman very exaggeratedly rolled her eyes. I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù at this point and we go back to our meal. Some waiters come over and offer to piece together some of the smaller bar tables on the ground floor into one large table but I guess they didn‚Äôt want that (we weren‚Äôt close enough to hear why). Finally our waitress and hostess comes over (couple waits by door) asking if we can finish in ~30 minutes if they rush our order and bring all the food out at once. My husband and I are like ‚Äúobviously not we‚Äôre not going to glug our wine and inhale our food‚Äù and they relent and go tell the couple we‚Äôre not moving. Then the couple leaves.\\n\\nActually, looking back now it‚Äôs possible that couple knew people at this restaurant since the hostess/waiters seemed exceptionally frantic when they couldn‚Äôt get our table and kept apologizing. I remember being kind of annoyed they were acting like that when they basically wanted to kick us out minutes earlier. Could be speculation but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they were important somehow and the restaurant didn‚Äôt want to piss them off.',\n",

Partly cause im a feminist hippie yada yada etc etc, and also cause it fucking hurts to shave and constantly have ingrown hairs and pokey stubble growing back in, esp. in those sensitive areas. Well its getting closer to bathing suit season and my mom has revealed to me recently that several people in the family have commented on my hairy bikini area when we go swimming and how they thought it was embarrasing that I dont shave it. My mom thinks it embarrasing for my 17yo nephew and my neice's husband and basically all the men in my family to have to see that. \\n \\nMy initial reaction is, well so what?  They can just deal with it and accept that women arent bald little girls. THEY HAVE HAIR DOWN THERE. And some of them have a lot. If we as a society find it acceptable for women to wear bikinis in public then shouldn't we also accept the fact that women have hair down there too and stop trying to pretend like we dont? Why is it considered vulgar? Whats the big fucking deal with women's body hair? My mom made it seem like I was just putting these men in a horribly awkward position to have to look at that. And i guess for many of them it is, cause our culture has raised them that way.  On one hand I don't want to embarrass people esp. someone like my sweet nephew, but on the other hand I say, fuck that, they need to just learn to accept it and let me enjoy the beach and pool and leave me be.\\n\\n\\nEdit-  I imagine that you all picture me running around in my tiny bikini like this https://images.app.goo.gl/MJeg2HSJsdQwxuek6\\nI actually wear a very conservative vintage style one piece.  My actual crotch area is fully covered to my upper thighs and my vulva hair is contained in the bathing suit. No high cuts or string bikinis for me.  The hair that is out for the world to see is basically just my inner and upper thigh area. Also I have tried those little bathing suit shorts you all are suggesting but they all ride up and end up showing the same parts anyway.... I may just take some scissors and trim a little.\\n \\nEdit #2- changed vagina to vulva so ppl wouldn't be assholes about me not using scientifically correct wording.   Also, thanks for all the input.  This has been fun to read. A few of the commenters are complete assholes, I'm surprised nobody picked up on my username and called me sascrotch or something (which I actually would have laughed at). I know its hard not to look at that area if it has hair there. I dont think anyone who notices it are pervs. Its ok, I know its shocking because its not normal. But im also not doing it for shock value. Honestly if I saw a woman wearing a bathing suit and was hairy I would do a double take and make some funny remark to myself in my head but also probably be happy to be in the presence of a kindred spirit. Most of you probably won't even read this edit cause the thread is dying down, but anyway, maybe I'll trim my upper thigh crease hair(not my vulva hair btw) to give my family a break, maybe I wont. If I do it won't be from shame.\",\n",

I sent the report in and quickly received a message from Lyft expressing concern and interest in resolving the issue. Do I want him fired? No, hence this post. I just want him to be reminded on how to prioritize the experience the customer is paying for.\\n\\nEDIT 2: This is my final say on the matter. This was not a flattering event for me. My ride was uncomfortable due to the driver‚Äôs lack of awareness & decorum. I too, work at a job where ratings matter. I do my very best to make sure that my customers feel safe and comfortable. I was a captive audience the whole car ride, and that was taken advantage of. \\n\\nI did not expect this post to blow up, but since it did, please read these responses with empathy and learn something today.

She had 2 more kids with this guy. \\n\\nWhen my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn‚Äôt give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. \\n\\nSince I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that‚Äôs much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I‚Äôm living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. \\n\\nI moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we‚Äôve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I‚Äôm grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. \\n\\nFor the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don‚Äôt. She keeps telling me that ‚Äòeven if I don‚Äôt forgive her I should look out for the kids as they‚Äôre innocent in all this‚Äô \\n\\nAITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family?

I respectfully disagreed, a minor argument ensued, and it ended with her wanting to do the sex strike shit, to show solidarity.\\n\\nNow I'm not just about sex and shit, but a sex strike, because of some celebrity seems to be insane.

       " 'So my husband and I both have really BIG families. I originally wanted a child free wedding, but hubby thought there would be too many hurt feelings over it, especially since I did still want my little sister there as a flower girl. My cousin, Anne, has a 5 year old son, let\\'s call him Ben, who has autism. I love Ben to death, he\\'s a sweetheart, but he has a tendency to act out and throw long tantrums, so I was a little nervous about having him there. I tried to have a heart to heart about this with Anne as delicately as I could, but she immediately got offended and told me she \"knows how to control her son.\"\\n\\nSo it\\'s my wedding day. I wasn\\'t there to hear it because I hadn\\'t walked down the aisle yet, but our officiant makes an announcement about our unplugged ceremony preference. A pretty common practice. My dad walks me down the aisle and I\\'m seriously overjoyed. And then I hear it. Ben has an iPad that Anne gives him to keep him occupied. He can sit in front of it for hours watching YouTube videos about trucks. She gives it to him all the time at restaurants and stores to keep him occupied. And she also gave it to him on my fucking wedding day. \\n\\nBen is on his iPad, watching his truck song videos at a more than audible volume and Anne is just........ letting him. It totally throws me off and I think my poor officiant saw the complete panic on my face because he stopped and did another quick \"reminder\" about our unplugged preference. Anne didn\\'t get the hint? My husband said it was fine and told him to keep going because he doesn\\'t like making a scene, but seriously, all I can hear is this fucking truck song and the quiet chaos going on around it. At this point, people start telling Ben to shut it off and Anne is telling them to leave him alone. My stepbrother told her to take him out, which just made Anne cry, so then I have to say my vows to the tune of Truck Tunes and my cousin crying and the uncomfortable laughter from some of our other guests.\\n\\nI\\'d definitely consider my wedding ceremony ruined, which we put a LOT of money into, and I\\'m still livid about it. I didn\\'t speak to Anne at the reception, and later SHE confronted ME about how she couldn\\'t believe I let her and Ben be humiliated like that at the ceremony. WHAT. I went off on her. Totally lost my mind and said a bunch of shit about how she lacks any shred of awareness or common decency, among other not so nice words. My mom thinks I\\'m overreacting and that it really \"wasn\\'t that bad\" and \"kind of funny if you think about it\" and that the iPad debacle was way better than Ben having a meltdown in the middle of the ceremony without it. She thinks I should apologize to Anne and basically give her a pass because she\\'s the single mother of an autistic kid, but I just don\\'t think it\\'s fair to play the disability card here.

Her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). Her mother is not happy. She hasn't been happy for a long time. Her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids I've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.\\n\\nShe's made it no secret she hates me. I remember when she was 13 or 14, I paid for us to go to Disney land as a family vacation (cliche, I know). She refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. I was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, I went along with it and stayed home.\\n\\nStuff like that is the norm. She'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. She'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. It's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. But it's ruined the marriage, because I've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. Anything I do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. Though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.\\n\\nAnyway, my wife and I separated over this. It's just too much for me to bare. But I'm not mad at my wife, I'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.\\n\\nI decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. I didn't do this to spite her, because frankly I'm ready to move on with my life. I did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. I did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)\\n\\nWife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this.

Often she would just walk out and leave without acknowledging my parents. My parents pulled me aside and told me this. I thought OK that sucks but we can talk it out and I can make her understand. I know we are all raised differently and have different customs, so I pulled my GF aside and explained this to her. She was receptive and she began to greet them and say goodbye properly. Initially she was a bit cold/shut off to my parents but they gradually warmed up to her. Not that they didn\\'t get along but she just had her walls up for some reason.

We reconnected about a year ago and, while I didn\\'t move back in, our relationship is a bit more stable than it was previously. \\n\\nThroughout my teenage years, I would get pretty sick almost every time I ate and as a result, didn\\'t eat a lot and was pretty underweight. Since leaving my mum\\'s house, I\\'ve made several lifestyle changes and concluded that I\\'m probably lactose intolerant, as the sickness after eating went away after I cut out dairy. Thing is, Mum doesn\\'t believe me. She thinks my boyfriend (who is vegan) is \"brainwashing\" me into thinking dairy is poison and accuses me of having an eating disorder. The comments I can brush off, but the issue comes with food she makes. She *always* manages to sneak dairy products into somehow, as if she\\'s trying to \"catch me out\". The one time she witnessed me being sick after eating something she\\'d snuck quite a lot of milk into, she accused me of forcing myself to vomit. She did say she would stop doing it, but I know she hasn\\'t because I *still* get sick every time I eat at her house. I\\'ve asked if I can just bring my own food and she said no, so I\\'ve just stopped eating at her house. \\n\\nMy stepdad, my grandparents and my aunt have all text me to tell me how offended my mum is and how much of a difficult brat I\\'m being. I\\'ve tried explaining that dairy makes me sick and she keeps sneaking it into my food.

      "Original Text: My brother was recently diagnosed with late stage colon cancer and has been in hospital multiple times to get assessments and diagnostic testing. The definitive treatment is a surgery and lengthy hospital stay which costs about $25k out-of-pocket after insurance deductions, and quoted at 70% cure rate. He and my SIL are unable to afford this as they have combined debts of $40k including student loans and not eligible to take more credit. They can at most put together $5000 in time to have the surgery soon enough that it's still effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came to me asking for a loan of $20k. This is my brother here, and they have a 4-year-old daughter and I wouldn't wish for anyone to see their dad die. But $20k is not something we can readily hand out. Debt can destroy lives, and if my wife and I have a mortgage to pay off. If we are out $20k (which will probably get turned into a gift because that's just how loans to family and friends work) and either me or my wife lose our jobs, we'll be in trouble. We have no other family able to help pitch in a significant amount. I told them we can't come up with that much money without going into significant debt (i.e. taking out another loan), and both of them were begging me to consider the loan option. AITA?\n",

      "\n",
      "He said that he didn't need to because he didn't want to be involved in the grieving process of having to go through what he did. I thought that was stupid because he had decided to wait until his family could see him at all for the funeral. I told him that I didn't want to be involved in the grieving process of having to go through what he did and that he would need to go through what he did because he didn't want to be involved in that process. He told me he didn't have to go through what he was doing and was just leaving the house. \n",
