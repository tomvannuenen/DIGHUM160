    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are machine learning systems trained to predict the next word in a sequence of text. They‚Äôre called ‚Äúlarge‚Äù because they‚Äôre built using massive amounts of text data and contain billions of parameters‚Äîtunable weights that determine the model‚Äôs behavior.\n",

    "LLMs learn patterns in language by analyzing word sequences, grammar, facts, and even writing styles from their training data. Rather than memorizing specific phrases, they build a statistical understanding of how language works. This allows them to generate surprisingly fluent and coherent text, answer questions, summarize content, and more."

    "# What is GPT-2?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)**, developed by OpenAI, is a well-known example of an LLM. It‚Äôs trained on a broad dataset from the internet and can generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"GPT\" Stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. *Generative*, because it generates text. Pre-trained, because it has been trained on a massive amount of data, and \"pre\" insinuates one could further train, or **finetune**, this model. A *transformer* is a specific kind of neural network. You can build different models from transformer architecture; the training goal of GPT is to take in a piece of text, and produce a prediction of what comes next in the passage.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 is a model from 2019. It was trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. In this notebook, we are using GPT-2 Small, the base model, which has only (!) 117 million parameters (for comparison, GPT-2 XL has 1.5 billion parameters, and GPT4 has 175 *billion*). A \"parameter\" is an adjustable internal value that the model learns and uses to make predictions or generate text based on its input. More parameters usually means a \"smarter\", more capable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this smaller model to make it possible to finetune it on a local computer (although you still need a pretty recent machine to run the code in this notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is fine-tuning?\n",
    "Fine-tuning GPT-2 on a specific dataset, like our r/amitheasshole dataset, customizes the model's responses to reflect the themes, style, language, or idioms found within that corpus. This process tailors the model's generative capabilities, making it more likely to produce outputs that are stylistically and thematically aligned with the fine-tuning material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's adaptation will be more pronounced when generating text related to or prompted by the domain we train it on. This might include specific narrative styles, dialogue structures, and  conventions unique to Am I The Asshole.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weight Adjustment\n",
    "Fine-tuning adjusts the weights of the neural network to minimize the loss on the new data. The changes in weights help the model better predict or generate sequences that resemble the fine-tuning data."

    "Even though we are only training a small model, the following blocks of code operation will take long on a consumer-grade PC (for reference: around 4 hours on an Apple M2 Pro with 16GB memory). I have run this code and saved the model, so you don't have to run it yourself. Please move on to \"Getting the Model From Google Drive\". \n",

    "\n",
    "Time to start the finetuning process. We first load in our r/aita dataset and initialize a tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tokenizer performs several critical tasks to convert raw text into a format that the GPT-2 model can understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splitting Text into Tokens: The tokenizer breaks down input text into tokens. For GPT-2, these tokens are usually subwords or characters, allowing the model to handle a wide range of words and vocabularies efficiently.\n",
    "- Converting Tokens to IDs: Each token is mapped to a unique integer ID based on the GPT-2 vocabulary. This conversion is necessary because neural networks operate on numerical data, not raw text.\n",
    "- Adding Special Tokens: GPT-2 requires certain special tokens for its operation (e.g., end-of-text token). The tokenizer takes care of adding these tokens where appropriate.\n",
    "- Padding & Truncation: To process batches of data efficiently, all input sequences must be of the same length. The tokenizer can pad shorter sequences with a special padding token or truncate longer ones to a maximum length.\n",
    "- Creating Attention Masks: The tokenizer generates attention masks to differentiate real tokens from padding tokens. This helps the model pay attention to relevant tokens and ignore padded areas."

       "['Just recently, our local Walmart and Target have begun to ask for receipts as patrons are leaving the store. At first I would oblige. I thought \"Whatever, it will only take a few seconds, NBD\". But as it happens more and more, I\\'m starting to realize not everyone is being asked to do this. Often times I\\'m having my groceries checked against my receipt as I watch multiple people walk right past us.\\n\\nI thought maybe they were just looking over receipts whenever possible. But one time the \"greeter\" wasn\\'t busy with anyone else. I watched 4 or 5 shoppers walk right out without a word from her, but as I was about to leave, she asks me aside.\\n\\nAt this point I start thinking, I\\'m a young male shopping alone, maybe I\\'m being profiled. So, after she asks politely to see my receipt I respond with \"No thanks.\" and continue out of the store. She looked a little puzzled, but...\\n\\nWow, nothing happened. That\\'s an awful lot more convenient than being \"nice\". So, that\\'s been my default response for the past few weeks. A greeter asks me to provide my receipt and I say \"No Thanks/No/Nope/Nah/Maybe next time/etc.\" with no issues. That is, until last night.\\n\\nI was on my way home from work, when my roommate asks me to pick up a jar of peanut butter. So, I get to the store, find the peanut butter, ring myself up, pay, and make my way to the doors. As I\\'m leaving, an older man says \"Hold up! Let me see your receipt.\", to which I respond \"Nah.\", and continue on my way. He stands up from his chair, raising his voice just a little, and says \"You need to pay for that!\", and I respond \"I did, have a good night!\"\\n\\nThis is when it gets a little weird. He\\'s clearly unconvinced, and begins to yell \"YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME YOUR RECEIPT!\" while following me out into the parking lot. I stop, turn around, and say \"I paid for this, it\\'s my property now, transaction complete\". He just gets even angrier, demanding that I show him my receipt, yelling \"You have to pay for that\" and \"You have to show me your receipt\" non stop.\\n\\nEventually I make it to my car, which he proceeds to stand in front of. Now, he\\'s saying he\\'s going to call the police, yadda yadda. I roll down my window and tell him \"That\\'s fine, you can call them, I don\\'t mind. Can you get away from my car?\", and he responds \"Like hell I will!\" while slamming his hands onto the hood of my car.\\n\\nAt this point I just want to go home. I look around my car and there are no people or cars anywhere nearby. So I quickly reverse my car away from him, and high tail it out of there.\\n\\nAfter recounting this story to my roommates, they said I was a total prick about it. They think that since it would have only taken a second to confirm that I paid for the peanut butter, that means I should have just shown him my receipt and been done with it. \\n\\nBut I think that\\'s bullshit. These stores shouldn\\'t operate on the assumption that I\\'m a thief by default.\\n\\nSo, what does reddit think. AITA?',\n",

His parents need their own space. Our place also doesn‚Äôt have the accommodations his father might need. He argued that my brother and BIL can wait another year or so to move in, but his dad needs to start treatments soon. They can renew their lease and I can help them with rent. \\n\\nHowever, my ILs are well off and can afford to rent a place that fit their needs. Additionally, my fianc√© has two siblings with good paying jobs that can help pay his parent‚Äôs expenses. My brother and BIL only have me to help. \\n\\nMy fianc√© is still mad at me.

They can at most put together $5000 in time to have the surgery soon enough that it's still effective.\\n\\nThey came to me asking for a loan of $20k. This is my brother here, and they have a 4-year-old daughter and I wouldn't wish for anyone to see their dad die. But $20k is not something we can readily hand out.

If we are out $20k (which will probably get turned into a gift because that's just how loans to family and friends work) and either me or my wife lose our jobs, we'll be in trouble. We have no other family able to help pitch in a significant amount. I told them we can't come up with that much money without going into significant debt (i.e. taking out another loan), and both of them were begging me to consider the loan option. AITA?\",\n",

Anyways, when she was eating with it, my dad pointed it out to her and asked \"why on earth are you eating with that tiny spoon?

Hes also a gaming junkie-like the worst of their kind. For example, when a game is being released, he waits up until midnight to purchase the game (no matter how expensive) and will binge on it for weeks straight while hardly sleeping. During this time you will be lucky to get so much as a \"hello\" out of him without him getting pissed for you disrupting him.

       " 'So about 5 months ago I (29F) got a new place with two of my friends, let\\'s call them Todd(33M) and Jess(32F). The three of us split rent and utilities equally. We all have a similar cleanliness level and a general rule of clean up after yourself. Everyone does their own laundry, keeps their bedrooms tidy, and the common spaces like the livingroom and kitchen get cleaned regularly by all of us. It\\'s a pretty decent situation that keeps everyone happy. \\n\\nNow Todd is very vocal about hating cooking all around. He likes to eat but cant stand the act of actually making food. So Jess and I made a deal with him, we will cook dinner if he does the dinner dishes. He agreed and loves that he can come home from work, crack a cold one, and put his feet up. \\n\\nThe issues in question occurred a few days ago. I made dinner for everyone, we ate dinner and watched TV together, the night came to a close and everyone went to bed. The next morning Todd left for work, Jess left for work, and I got up to start my job (I work from home) only to realize the dishes had never been done. I figured he was just tired and didn\\'t have the energy to do them, no biggie. So I put all the dishes nicely into the sink, and wiped down the counters while I was waiting for coffee to brew. \\n\\nThe day proceeds like normal, everyone gets home from work. Jess and I discuss what we will cook for dinner and realize that we need some of the dishes from the previous night. We ask Todd if he will wash them and he grumbles saying how he\\'s had a long day and doesn\\'t want to be on his feet any longer. I press him and say I\\'ve worked a full day and so had Jess but we are making dinner so he should do his part and wash the dishes for us. \\n\\nIt turned into a big argument about how his work is harder than ours because he works outside on his feet all day while Jess gets to be in AC and I get to be home all day so I\\'m practically not working. \\n\\nEveryone is still mad and I have refused to cook dinner for everyone if Todd doesn\\'t do the dishes anymore. \\n\\nSo reddit, AITA for disrupting the balance of the house?\\n\\nAlso obligatory \"sorry I\\'m on mobile\" for any typos.\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your kind words and support in the issue. We have a \"family meeting\" planned for this evening after everyone gets off work. Yes we call it a family meeting because we are all close and basically each others chosen family.

I was fine with it because I was tired and I don\\'t want to be \"the one who dishes the same kind of soup every other night.\" I tried to explain that he agreed, maybe not at all, but that had to be up for conversation. I said \"Just because you don\\'t have friends then makes you feel as though you are talking to him.\" He said \"you\\'re being selfish and being childish\" and then I said \"You think it\\'s disrespectful for me when my roommates aren\\'t going to cook your food?\"\\n\\nHe was confused and said \"Well, you do you have the right to do that\" then he said \"yeah, I was thinking maybe you just don\\'t know if one of your roommates would just like things like that?\" I said \"so yeah, I\\'m just an asshole.\" He said \"no, I love to cook and he does love his food.\" He said \"well, but I\\'m more than welcome to eat with the other person.\" He said \"You aren\\'t going to be a asshole if you\\'re not comfortable with me having my food in the cup anymore than anyone else because I feel like you are the one who is eating my food. It doesn\\'t matter.\" I told him that I felt like he was being ridiculous in a way and that I wanted to compromise and clarify his point of view. He looked confused and said \"I wanted to talk to him. Why didn\\'t he just want to talk with me?\" and I went on to say \"well, maybe he has to think about us in a different way.\" He said \"We have different ways of talking and',\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Original Text: My brother was recently diagnosed with late stage colon cancer and has been in hospital multiple times to get assessments and diagnostic testing. The definitive treatment is a surgery and lengthy hospital stay which costs about $25k out-of-pocket after insurance deductions, and quoted at 70% cure rate. He and my SIL are unable to afford this as they have combined debts of $40k including student loans and not eligible to take more credit. They can at most put together $5000 in time to have the surgery soon enough that it's still effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came to me asking for a loan of $20k. This is my brother here, and they have a 4-year-old daughter and I wouldn't wish for anyone to see their dad die. But $20k is not something we can readily hand out. Debt can destroy lives, and if my wife and I have a mortgage to pay off. If we are out $20k (which will probably get turned into a gift because that's just how loans to family and friends work) and either me or my wife lose our jobs, we'll be in trouble. We have no other family able to help pitch in a significant amount. I told them we can't come up with that much money without going into significant debt (i.e. taking out another loan), and both of them were begging me to consider the loan option. AITA?\n",

I've never really appreciated that. I have already decided to pay for my son to go to the surgery to save for his life, but he seems to still believe that I should pay for him to go to the doctor's office, but I've said before he needs help to have a complete say in making that decision?\n",
